there are several branches, they are for:


master :	the one i will continue dev on
droboxUrl : 	prior to using github, page doc URL used dropbox  URL like
		https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31360775/psg/sourceControl.html
		this branch was created before adopting github.io as doc URL
		this branch would likely be a deadend/abandone branch

git branch dropboxUrl
git branch --edit-description dropboxUrl
# added description inside EDITOR, but don't know how to see it

git checkout dropboxUrl
git add BRANCH_INFO.txt
git commit -m "marker for dropboxUrl branch"
git push --set-upstream origin dropboxUrl
