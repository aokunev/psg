
there are several branches, they are for:


*sigh*   github.io pages will only build against master branch
so will merge sansDropSync back into master.
perhaps mark it with some release tag...


sansDropSync : 	stop using dropbox sync in this branch.
		moba, cygwin, mingw64, really messy
		diff uid, permission don't match, CRLF... 
		that's why real developer hate windows :(
		git remote add origin https://tin6150@github.com/tin6150/psg.git
		DIR: /cygdrive/c/tin-gh/psg

masterIwas :
master :	will abandone this branch.  it was done while using dropbox sync, which was messy.
		was going to rename this to masterIwas
		can rename locally, but not on origin :(
		even tried 
			git push -f origin :master
		gave up renaming.  will just make sandDropSync default chckout/clone

droboxUrl : 	prior to using github, page doc URL used dropbox  URL like
		https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31360775/psg/sourceControl.html
		this branch was created before adopting github.io as doc URL
		this branch would likely be a deadend/abandone branch

snap20161016 : 	a snapshot taken in oct, mostly for backup purpose
		no further dev on this branch



commands used to create the dropboxUrl branch:
git branch dropboxUrl
git branch --edit-description dropboxUrl
# added description inside EDITOR, but don't know how to see it

git checkout dropboxUrl
git add BRANCH_INFO.txt
git commit -m "marker for dropboxUrl branch"
git push --set-upstream origin dropboxUrl


## git branch state prior to this commit
  $ git branch -vv
  dropboxUrl   d3e4692 [origin/dropboxUrl] marker (2) for dropboxUrl branch
  * master       2b6e82e [origin/master] adding google_tracking file
  snap20161016 1a66ca2 added progit ref
