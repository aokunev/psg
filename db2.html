<H1>DB2</H1>


<PRE>

Main DB2 interface components:

. db2profile	profile in each instance to be sourced to setup path, 
		db2 register variable, java stustuff, etc
		File in instance dir, eg /lhome/db2inst8/sqllib/

db2fs		db2 first steps, a getting started wizard.

db2cc		Control Center, GUI, lead to many other GUI.
db2		DB2>  The CLI for all db2 admin.

db2ca		config assistant, help client config of connectivity.
		also as lightweight Control Ctr
db2hc		health center, for monitoring and stuff


db2ilist	list db2 instances 
		AIX: /usr/opt/db2_08_01/bin
		Sol:    /opt/IBM/db2/V8.1/bin

db2icrt	 -u FENCEID INST_NAME		# create instance eg db2fenc8 db2inst8
	# !! 	Note: before creating instance, do:
	# !! 	cd /lhome/INST_NAME ; touch .profile .login
	# !! 	It maybe the case that db2 does not like instance name w/ - in them
	# !!	At least, db2sampl failed when instance/username was uca2-db2

db2idrop INST_NAME			# delete instance
		AIX: /usr/opt/db2_08_01/instance/
		Sol:    /opt/IBM/db2/V8.1/instance/


db2 catalog tcpip node pecan remote pecan.brio.com server 50000
db2 catalog database epam    as epam_p  at node pecan
db2 catalog database epam1   as epam_p1 at node pecan
db2 catalog database epam_ea7           at node pecan


db2 update dbm cfg using svcename 50000
db2 get    dbm cfg | grep SVCENAME
db2set DB2COMM=TCPIP
		allow remote admin via db2cc, port 50000
db2set -all
		list db2 registry var


Prodecure for stopping the DB2 server (all db2 related process).


Log on as root and enter the following commands for each instance:

    su - iname
    . $HOME/sqllib/db2profile
    db2 force applications all
    db2 terminate
    db2stop
    db2licd end      # run at each physical node	(license svr)
    exit


where iname is the instance owner name.

Then, while still logged on as root, enter the following commands:

    su - aname
    . $HOME/sqllib/db2profile
    db2admin stop
    exit

where aname is the administration server name.

Installation and Configuration Supplement.pdf
p 17 and 138:

license management.  needed after manual install.
INSTHOME/.../db2diag.log  will also show expiration in X day(s).

adm/db2licm 	-l list licenses, including prod password for futher update
		-n PASSWORD 4	increase to 4 cpu
	    	-? help
adm/db2licm 	-a FILENAME
where FILENAME is license file on cdrom /db2/license/db2ese.lic
Stored in /var/ifor (AIX) or /var/lum (Unix,Linux)

license files needed before running products:
(potentially need to run db2licm on all avail lic)
db2ese.lic	enterprise svr ed (used in tahoe from soft access catalog download)
db2dlm.lic	data link 
db2wsue.lic	work group serv unlimed ed
db2conee.lic	connect ent ed (seen a few on sandpail)
...		plus other, see list in pdf.

db2 select COLUMN-NAME from TABLE-NAME
db2 select COLUMN-NAME from TABLE-NAME where CONDITION
db2 select count(*) from TABLE-NAME

NOTE: db2 command automatically do commit, to turn it off, use param '+c'


---------------

DB2 user priviledges stuff.  These SLQ commands does not work in Oracle.

user exist as std unix acc user.

grant DBADM,CREATETAB,BINDADD,CONNECT,CREATE_NOT_FENCED_ROUTINE,IMPLICIT_SCHEMA,
LOAD,CREATE_EXTERNAL_ROUTINE,QUIESCE_CONNECT on database to user THO;

db2 grant DBADM,CREATETAB,BINDADD,CONNECT on database to user THO;

--- 

db2osconf	display kernel param needed by db2, os config dependent.

For Solaris /etc/system:

set msgsys:msginfo_msgmax=65535
set msgsys:msginfo_msgmnb=65535
set msgsys:msginfo_msgmni=2560
set msgsys:msginfo_msgtql=2560
set semsys:seminfo_semmni=3072
set semsys:seminfo_semmns=6452
set semsys:seminfo_semmnu=3072
set semsys:seminfo_semume=240
set shmsys:shminfo_shmmni=3072
set shmsys:shminfo_shmseg=240
set shmsys:shminfo_shmmax=1869321830

The last entry, shminfo_shmmax, seems to suck up 1.8 GB out of a 2 GB system.  
Oracle setup only wanted 1 GB.  However, setting it to 1 GB seems to have caused
some GUI tools like configuration advisor not being able to perform update.
So set it to 1.5 GB and seems a bit better.  Too high, and the system don't seems to have resources for other task.


Other config param

db2 get dbm cfg			# dbm is shortcut for database manager
db2 get db cfg			# need db2 connect to DATABASE 1st, DB specific
db2 get admin configuration	# DAS config

dbheap
memory for connection, freed when last app disconnect. 
Also space for logbufsz and catalogcache_sz are allocated from here.

default = 1200, range 32-60k.


many params can be set on db2cc GUI via right click on DB, then configure parameters or configure advisor that walk thru std scenarios.  Good to tell DB to use less than 80% of memory as target for system that is more than just a DB.




---


db2 

install program via db2setup
update FixPack, it comes with script

config kernel param.
reboot.
(db2 process is in /etc/inittab !!)

Create instance and fence user

For instance user, touch .profile and .login

as root, run:
/opt/IBM/db2/V8.1/instance/db2icrt -u db2fenc8 db2inst8  #last one match instance user.

as db2inst8 user (or db2i81 in tahoe), run
. sqllib/db2profile (actually in .profile).

db2ilist	# list intances
db2level	# get version info
db2sampl	# create sample db
db2start

testing:
db2 connect to sample
db2 "select * from staff where dept = 20"
db2 connect reset

# eg2, running user is general user, connect to db as db2i81
# which get all table as its own schema space.
db2 connect to sample user db2i81
db2 "select * from db2i81.staff"


************************************************************

DAS - db2 admin server - central point for remote control
	See Admin Guide: Implementation, p44

server side config:

dascrt -u das-username
	in /opt/IBM/db2/V8.1/instance/
	create DAS instanve as a specific user.

dasdrop ASName
		/opt/IBM/db2/V8.1/instance/
		ASName is the das instance being removed.
		typically match das-username
		remove previous instance as needed.

db2admin start|stop
	in /opt/IBM/db2/V8.1/das/bin/
	start, stop or (no param) check das status
	also add/remove db2 users (apart from os user)

dasupdt
	update das from fix pack 

db2 create tools catalog TOOLS_CAT create new database TOOLS_DB
	Create a tools catalog db, used by DAS to store schedule task, etc.
	usually it is setup at install time.

db2set -i db2i81 db2comm=tcpip
db2 update dbm   cfg using svcename        50000
	# change to use port 50000, could also be name listed in /etc/services
db2stop
db2start

db2 update admin cfg using toolscat_inst   db2i81
db2 update admin cfg using toolscat_db	   TOOLS_DB
db2 update admin cfg using toolscat_schema TOOLS_CAT	# catalog name
db2 update admin cfg using smtp_server     MAILHOST
db2 get    admin cfg | egrep TOOLSCAT_INST\|TOOLSCAT_DB
	change and verify param of admin (=DAS) 
	need to db2admin stop , start to make changes takes place.
	NOTE: at the end, did db2stop, db2start, and das worked w/o above conf.

db2 reset admin cfg
	reset all admin (=DAS) configuration to system default. 
	Essentially, it will erase prev setting.
	
DAS, client side config (but never got it to work)
- Admin Guide, Implementation, p 53
- Course #1, p 1-37
- Exercise   p 1-11

db2 catalog admin tcpip node TAHOE remote TAHOE system TAHOE ostype SUN
	admin refers to DAS config
	node is local client reference use only, can be any name
	ostype could also be AIX, LINUX, NT (or WIN?)

db2 catalog admin tcpip node TAHOE remote TAHOE server 50000 remote_instance DB2I81 system TAHOE ostype SUN
	command ref says "admin" cannot mix with "SERVER", think should rm admin
	node name again is local ref, need to be unique.
	And it may not be needed, maybe only for scheduler task storage...

db2 catalog db TOOLS_DB as TTOOLSDB at node TAHOE
	This add additional database for use in local sys.
	TOOLS_DB is the tools database used by DAS
	TTOOLSDB need to be locally unique name, not sure why needed
	again, i didn't get this to work, some sort of comm err, so may need revising
	NOTE, using GUI db2cc to add db seems to work much better!

Checking errors:

eg INSTHOME=/lhome/db2inst8
   DASHOME=/lhome/db2das8


$INSTHOME/sqllib/db2dump/
	db2diag.log 	text file
	INSTANCE.nfy	notification log, smaller text file than db2diag.log.  
	db2eventlog.nnn	?
$DASHOME/das/dump/db2dasdiag.log



---

Patching a Fix Pack, after instance has been created.

shutdown db2

cd to dir containing the untared patch files, run install script as root.
./install_...

The patch each instance:

cd INSHOME/instance/
INSHOME=/opt/IBM/db2/V8.1
./db2iupdt INSNAME      
                eg INSNAME db2i81
./dasupdt  DASNAME
                eg DASNAME db2das8

db2start

then some binding stuff for the tools...

su - db2i81
db2 terminate
db2 connect to <dbname> 
                        eg dbname tools_db

db2 bind /export/lhome/db2i81/sqllib/bnd/@db2ubind.lst blocking all grant public
db2 bind /export/lhome/db2i81/sqllib/bnd/@db2cli.lst   blocking all grant public
	 <path>                         /@...

should be all done at this point.


----------

db2 performance and tunning class 

ch 10.  Health Monitor

Run GUI health monitor, all info details , right click db, choose to start health monitor.

db2 get health snapshot for database on tp1
db2 get health snapshot for database on tp1 show detail
db2 get health snapshot for tablespaces on tp1

tp1 is a sample database name
**********************************************************
In solaris, there is a special version of ps that shows correct 
db2 engine process name instead of having it display db2cc.
See various binaries at:

/opt/IBM/db2/V8.1/bin/
	db2_ps		: 
	db2nps N	: node ps

They seems to req a DB2INSTANCE var set.

DB2 UDB Connectivity Cheat Sheets: Part 4
article from IBM that may help config DB2 client connectivity to server.



----

various database troubleshooting commands learned at job.

db2 ? 
	get help, list all commands

db2 ? list
        help on list command

db2 list database directory | grep 'Database alias'
        display list of databases (seems to be more than db2cc)
db2 list active databases
        see which database is active

db2 activate database <Database-Alias-name>
	activate a given database
	Note that error such as back end store removed does not seems to 
	return error on cli!
db2 deactivate database

db2 list applications
	List all active applications using the database.


Environment variable to check if things fails strangely:
DB2DIR="/usr/lpp/db2_07_01"		# DB2 ver 7
DB2DIR="/usr/opt/db2_08_01"		# DB2 ver 8
DB2INSTANCE=db2inst7
INSTHOME=/lhome/db2inst7


----

Note on DB2 and ldap.
If the system (AIX) search LDAP first instead of the local passwd account, 
and if there are some issues on the LDAP account that prevents login (/bin/false for shell),
then DB2 will not work at all.  Even if this is only a db2 client instance installation.
This is because DB2 client still depends on a instance installed locally on the machine,
and so the instance owner account need to be available for db2 to work at all.


DB2 on HP-UX.
kmtune parameter msgmax must be set to 65535 for db2 (client) to work.
maybe enhanced autofs changed it when it recompiles the kernel.
