<H1>LDAP</H1>

LDAP is a user database, and it does in Unix what MS Active Directory does in Windows.
From Operating System Admin perspective, LDAP would typically be used to replace NIS (or NIS+ or scattered local passwd files).  If you are pondering if you should migrate to LDAP, you'll wish the answer was 'NO' :)  
<BR>
LDAP is much more complex than NIS, and OS support is still not rock solid as in NIS [this was written back in 2006].  Automount maps retrieval from LDAP is quite complex and not well supported.  Older OS LDAP support is rather spotty, and forget about OS that have been EOL-ed by the vendor!
<BR>
So, in short, unless you know you need LDAP, stay away from it :)  And if you do use it, hopefully this page has some useful info for you.
<BR><BR>

<A ID="tree"></A>
<H2>LDAP Tree Conceptualization</H2>

While LDAP is a user "database" repository, do not think of it as a Relational Database.  It has no resemblance to RDBMS.  The only thing that bear resemblance from RDBMS is the "key" and maybe "attributes", other than that, forget everything you learned about Relational DB when working with LDAP.  Definately forget about those Boyce-Codd Normal Form!!

<A ID="user"></A>
<H2>LDAP User Management</H2>

To disable/lock out a user, one can add the attribute to the user dn:
<TT>nsAccountLock: true</TT>.
The GUI console provide a way to click "disable" under the Accounting tab.  
However, OS support for this flag is spotty.  For example, 
RHEL 3 does, but Solaris 8 does not.
Thus, the admin should change the user default shell to something like
/bin/false.
<BR><BR>

The Unix sys admin tradition is to also change the user's password to some random text to 
prevent the user from logging in.  Sure, theoretically, there is a chance the password could
still be guessed, but this isn't likely in practice, and may involve non-print characters.
Finally, note that if POSIX account is completely disabled, 
it would delete the UID info, which are typically
undesirable due to the need to keep UID/GID for historical reference (files ownership, etc).

<BR><BR>

<A ID="profile"></A>
<H2>LDAP Profile Management</H2>

Some OS need a profile to be stored on the LDAP server so that client side
LDAP config can be updated in a single server location, rather than updating
on each machine.  
In practice, profile may add too much complexity for too
little gain.  
<BR>
<BR>
Sun also claims profile add security, preventing user from joining a machine
to LDAP w/o the LDAP admin knowledge.  However, if the user have root in one
client, files in /var/ldap can be copied from one machine to another.  The
encrypted password is copied, obliviating the need to know any password to
bind to the Directory.  Lastly, most site allows anonymous bind just as ypcat
passwd is not secured anyway.
At the end of the day, the sys admin don't have a choice whether to use profiles or not.  
Solaris and HPUX use
profiles, and AIX and linux don't.  
<BR>
<BR>
Some admins like to create one profile for each version of a given OS, so that
vendor gratuitous changes in new version won't affect other versions.  This
come at a cost of maintaining more profiles.  Pick your own poison :)
On the other hand, if there are multiple sites, then site-specific profile
would typically make sense.
<BR><BR>
If there is only one domain, storing profiles near the root would be good.  
eg OU=profiles,dc=unixville,dc=com.  
But even if there are multiple domains, it maybe best to put them in the same
location anyway, using different name for profiles beloging to different
domain/site.  This is mostly to ensure client bind process can locate the
profile easily and no guess work as to which part of the tree the profile came
from.
<BR><BR>

<H6>Solaris</H6>
So far, Solaris 8 thru 10 can use the same profile without any noticeable
problem.  It seem easiest to create the profile from a Solaris 9 client and
bind using Directory Manager to seed this process.

<H6>HPUX</H6>
Each version of HP-UX add a bit more "feature" into the ldapux-profile.  
11.00 has a basic profile, 11.11 added something, yet 11.23 bloated it up even
more.  The nature of ldap client is that they ignore directives they don't
understand.  As such, it worked pretty well to seed the initial profile using
an 11.23 client, binding as Directory Manager to upload the profile directly
to the LDAP server.  Once done, the client can be reconfigured to bind as
proxy agent.
<BR><BR>
Lastly, I would like to mention that it is possible for LDAP-UX to use the
Solaris profile, at least for HP 11.11.  However, latest versions of the two
OSes seem to diverge and maintaining separate profiles may reduce compatibility
problems down the road.
<BR><BR>

<A ID="gotchas"></A>
<H2>LDAP Gotchas</H2>

<H5>Smart Referals</H5>
Probably want to stay away from them from NIS migration perspective.  
Linux is probably the only platform that supports it.  
AIX will traverse them and loop thru the many servers set by the smart referals and cause
huge delays in telnet session connection, automount maps retrieval, and make machine
extremely sluggish.
<BR>

Solaris, it is a bit better.  It still crosses the smart referal servers 
more often than needed, resulting in delayed performance.  Even when profile 
is set that it should not follow the smart referals, it doesn't honor it.
Performance is acceptable if smart referals is a must.  But even then, 
I don't see automount maps referals to function correctly.
<BR>

HP-UX.  Don't know if it cause problem yet, but it doesn't
provide the correct function of retrieving data from the 
smart referal automount maps.

<BR>
<BR>

<H5>RSH vs REXEC</H5>
The protocol definition for RSH vs REXEC and other similar command:

(a) rsh use the Berkeley rcmd(3) library,  and requires the binary to be setuid root 
    so that it run in priviledged ports and scan for .rhosts in remote server.<BR>
(b) rexec use the rexec(3) library.  It does not scan .rhosts so no need to run as root.  Instead,
    it provide user password in clear text to remote server to login.  remsh is the same as rsh, just renamed to avoid clash with the "restricted shell"<BR>
(c) rlogin is for remote console login.  It handles less control character than TELNET.  
    Most system implements "rsh host" w/o a command as a call to rlogin for interactive login.
    RSH is left for executing command on remote host and streaming the output back to the source machine.
    RLOGIN also uses the Berkeley rcmd(3) library. <BR>
(d) rcp is remote copy akin to rsh wrapped around files directly. <BR>
(e) ssh default behaviour is to emulate rsh with command.  For interactive login, it probably follows the rlogin algorithm, but hangles control characters much better, akin to telnet.  Further, ssh is smart enough not to read user login/password from a std out redirect, but must ask on an interactive keyboard (expect can emulate keyboard login).
<BR>
<BR>

Note that  <BR>
(1) RSH/RLOGIN/SSH scan user db differently than  <BR>
(2) TELNET/REXEC <BR>
At least in AIX, the former set seems to invariably look for local /etc/passwd user first,
whilst the latter look at LDAP.   nsswitch.conf on other system may have effect on this,
but Solaris 8 RSH is looking at local passwd first for sure.
Further note that AIX 5.3 "rsh hostname cmd" behaves more like (2).  It is a bizare world
of intricate details and buggy implementations a/o protocol :-/  
Note that aix man page on rexec says it only look at COMPAT but in fact it look at LDAP first!
<BR>
<BR>
AIX has a variable <TT>AUTHSTATE</TT> that get set to:
<LI>compat when login using rsh
<LI>LDAP   when login using telnet
<LI>files  can be set manually to force UID to username resolution thru files first (still go thru other method if it fails to find it in files).
<BR>
It seems safe to set this variable in /etc/profiles and /etc/csh.cshrc to
"compat" and all seems to work well, sourcing local files first.
<BR><BR>

<H5>RSH issues</H5>
RSH is likely to work in LDAP environment.  However, getting RSH to allow user
to login without prompting for password (use of the insecure .rhosts, etc) is
likely to be more problematic.  Solaris may need patches and config on
pam.conf.  HP-UX will need update on pam.conf, and perhaps a myriad of other
config depending on security model.  Refer to HP PAM doc.
<BR><BR>

<H5>SSH issues</H5>
<LI>If you compiled OpenSSH from source, you will need to include PAM support.
<LI>If you got openssh package from SunFreeware.com, the older version won't
work with LDAP.
<LI>If you are using vendor provided SSH, and vendor supplied LDAP libraries,
then all should be good.  If on the other hand third party LDAP libraries are
added, eg from PADL.com, then things may break.

<H5>Automount issues</H5>

The typical sys admin would put lot of automount maps on NIS, and just about every unix OS automount can retrieve these maps from NIS.  However, such assumption would be very wrong when migrating to LDAP.  While the LDAP server can store anything one throws at it, the data may not always be retrievable :(  
There is an rfc defining how to store automount maps in LDAP, and when configured correctly, will work.  But it need substantial client-side support.  Autofs on just about every OS client need to be updated.  Solaris 9 and older need patches.  AIX 5.2 and older don't have upgrades available.  HP-UX 11i can use the Enhanced-AutoFS package, but it need lot of OS patches and kernel recompilation to support it.  Newer Linux can run up2date to patch the autofs rpm.  See the 
<A HREF="#client">client</A> section below for more details.
In general, treat each version of each OS as an independent entry in the configuration matrix, and test everything to ensure your config works!

<TT>/opt/redhat-ds/slapd-ldapsvr/db2ldif -s dc=unixville,dc=com -a export.ldif</TT><BR>

Export all site data for the domain uxville.com, place it in LDIF format.
This file can then be edited, eg sed 's/\t/ /g' to remove all tabs, and then reimported.
<BR>
For the <TT>-a</TT> option, output file may need to have full path specified, and output location may need to be writable by user "nobody".  If option -a is not used, the output will be stored automatically in a location where "nobody" can write to, typically /opt/redhat-ds/slapd-ldapsvr/ldif.
<BR> <BR>

<TT>/opt/redhat-ds/slapd-ldapsvr/db2ldif -n userRoot</TT>
<BR>
Brief test, output info related to "default master db" that stores root-level data, such as profiles, etc.  It does not output data in 
sub-suffix databases related db that stores user data.  so it is usually small.

<H2>LDIF</H2>

LDIF is the standard data exchange format.  It is a simple ASCII file 
with special text formatting.  
Each entry has a dn.  Different entries are separated by blank lines.
line that begin with a space is considered to be continuation of 
previous line, which are typically wrapped at 80 chars.
Anything not presentable in standard ASCII will be uuencoded in base64.
<BR>
Besides LDIF, there is also format based on the XML standard called ____.  It seems
to be seldom used.

<A ID="fedora-ds"></A> 
<H1>FEDORA-DS</H1>

Fedora Directory Server is the open source version of RedHat Directory Server.<BR>
The RH DS came from the Netscape Directory Server (6.1).  The Netscape DS was also developed 
by Sun and branded as iPlanet DS and later Sun ONE DS.  HP also repackage the Netscape/Red Hat DSwith their LDAP-UX.  Thus, these products are largely the same.  
<BR>

<A ID="GUI"></A> 
<H2>GUI Console</H2>

Fedora DS has a Graphical Console.  There is two piece to it, an app/web server that typically configured to listen on port 5555, which can be started as: <BR>
<TT>
cd /opt/fedora-ds <BR>
./start-admin<BR> 
</TT>

And a client part.  A web browser can point to http://ldapsvr:5555/ and get lightweight ldap server queries, or use the full featured java client
which get started as:
<TT>
cd /opt/fedora-ds <BR>
./startconsole<BR>
</TT>

The GUI console can be used to perform admin task on the Directory Server configuration or for modifying data in the LDAP data tree.
Below are several examples of adding objects in the "database" tab.
<BR><BR>

<H4>Add Unix User</H4>
Right click on the People OU, click <TT>new, user</TT>.  For Unix user, check on the Posix Account entry.  Furthermore, go to advance attributes and add the "shadowAccount" attribute.
<BR><BR>

<H4>Add Unix Group</H4>
Right click on the Groups OU, click <TT>new, other object, posix group</TT>.  
<BR><BR>


<A ID="GUI_automount"></A>
<H4>Add Automount Map</H4>

automount map is for defining an entirely new set of automount entries, such as /import, /products, etc.
<BR>
Here is an example for defining automount maps in LDAP for the first time, 
adding a auto.master, auto_master and finally a sample indirect map for /nfshome .
<I>Pay special attention to dot(.) vs underscore(_) below.</I>
<BR>

<OL>

<BR><EM>Defining auto.master</EM> (master map used by Linux, AIX and HP-UX?)
<LI>Right click on the desired OU where the automount map should be added (eg, ou=sc,ou=ca,ou=na,dc=hybridauto,dc=com)
<LI>Click <TT>new, other object, automountMap</TT>
<LI>Enter "<TT>auto.master</TT>" in the automountMapName field.
<LI>Then, inside this newly created auto.master object, right click, <TT> new, other object, automount</TT>
<LI>In the automountInformation field, enter info like "<TT>ldap:automountMapName=auto_nfshome,ou=sc,ou=ca,ou=na,dc=hybridauto,dc=com</TT>"
<LI>In the automountkey field, enter "<TT>/nfshome</TT>"

<BR><BR><EM>Defining auto<STRONG>_</STRONG>master</EM> (master map used by Solaris?)<BR>
<LI>Right click on the desired OU, as in step 1 above
<LI>Click <TT>new, other object, automountMap</TT>
<LI>Enter "<TT>auto_master</TT>" in the automountMapName field.
<LI>Then, inside this newly created auto_master object, right click, <TT> new, other object, automount</TT>
<LI>In the automountInformation field, enter info like "<TT>auto_nfshome</TT>"
<LI>In the automountkey field, enter "<TT>/nfshome</TT>"

<BR><BR><EM>Defining auto_nfshome</EM> (indirect map used by all systems)
<LI>Right click on the desired OU, as in step 1 above
<LI>Click <TT>new, other object, automountMap</TT>
<LI>Enter "<TT>auto_nfshome</TT>" in the automountMapName field.
<LI>Entries in auto_nfshome will be added in the section below "Add Automount Entry".
</OL>

The info can be verified by using ldapsearch and compare it against the ldif used in the
ldapadd section 
<A HREF="#ldapadd_automount">above</A>.
<BR><BR>


<H4>Add Automount Entry</H4>

Sample automount entries would be the various user's home dir that are defined under /home.
Thus, /nfshome/tin with content of nfssvr:/export/home/tin would be one automount entry.  <BR>

For user home directory that need atuomount entry to define which server to use for the actual mount, 
To add a new entry:
<OL>
<LI>right click on the desired automount map (eg auto_nfshome)
<LI>click <TT>new, other object, automount</TT>.  
<LI>Enter the mount key into the automountKey field
<LI>Enter mount path info and mount option into the automountInformation field
</OL>
<BR>

<A ID="password_encryption"></A>
<H4>Change Default Posix (Unix) Password Encryption</H4>

When creating unix user account using the GUI console, the password strings need to be encrypted in the same method  that client OS expectes them to.  While newer OS can support MD5 or SSHA, CRYPT is still the universal standard.  Thus, it is best to set the console to encrypt user password using CRYPT by default.  Solaris NIS use CRYPT by default.
<BR><BR>

Method 1 - What Red Hat consultant told me and I know it works:
<BR>

<OL>
<LI>Go to the Directory tab
<LI>Click on the config node in the tree, right click, select advance properties (in a nutshell, we are editing the properties for the node <TT>cn=config</TT>.
<LI>Scroll to the bottom where the attribute "passwordStorageScheme" is listed.  By default, it says SSHA.  Change it to say "<TT>CRYPT</TT>"
</OL>

Method 2 - What is described by the Admin Guide:
<BR>

<OL>
<LI>Go to Config tab, 
<LI>Data node in the LDAP tree.
<LI>On right side, go to Password tab.  Toward the bottom, it has option to choose
password encryption policy.  The default is SSHA, change it to CRYPT.  
</OL>

<BR>

To verify that default password is created using CRYPT, perform a password change on a test user, then perform ldapsearch on this user using the <TT>cn=Directory Manager</TT> credentials.  Encryption method is prefixed as {CRYPT} or {SSHA}.

<A ID="backup"></A> 
<H2>Backing up DB</H2>

<PRE>
/opt/fedora-ds/slapd-SVR/db2bak		# run the backup
/opt/fedora-ds/slapd-SVR/bak/DATE/	# dir where the files are stored (mostly Berkeley DB files)
</PRE>

<H2>Index</H2>
Some fields are not indexed by default, and when used as a NIS replacement,
having these indexes would greatly improve performance.  

<UL>
<LI>gidnumber
<LI>uidnumber
</UL>
<BR>

To create indexes, 

<OL>
<LI>Go to config tab
<LI>Click on "data" on the ldap tree
<LI>Expand to the desired database container config, indexes tab should appear
on right
<LI>Click on attribute, and select the attribute that should be added to the
index.
<LI>Typically, equality is the box that need to be checked for indexing to  be
performed on.
</OL>
The above steps need to be done on each LDAP server, on each database
repository (eg when different domains/OU use different database backend).

<BR><BR>

  <H2>Replication Conflicts </H2>

Records from replications with conflicts are marked by nsds5ReplConflict.
If the conflicts are specific to a single domain (and espcially in a dedicated
consumer), the easiest way to remove them is to "Initialize the Consumer" from
the Replication Config.

<br>
When defining the replication agreements, for database that need multi-master, it maybe best to select such type of replication from the beginning.  This is because the GUI console is rather buggy, and it has a tendency to put in a random number if the replication is first setup as dedicated consumer.  If error happens, it is probaby best to blow away the replication agreement and redo it.  For those really brave, the slapd server can be shut down and edit the dse.ldif file manually :)
It was actually possible to define the replication agreement as ldif file that one just paste into the dse.ldif, but I don't konw the details.

<BR><br>

Other things to remember when setting up additional server:
<LI> Copy custom schemas into the schema directory and restart the DS.
     /opt/redhat-ds/slapd-*/config/schema, typically starts with number 61
     thru 98.
<LI> Uniqueness plugin, either thru ldif import or set them up manually on the
     GUI console.
<LI> Tail the error logs when doing replicaiton test.  Sometime console reports status as good but when in fact error log shows replication problems.
<LI> Ensure each server is assigned a uniq replicaiton id.  Last octet(s) of the server IP address may work.  Naming the servers with numerical sequence and using that number may also be a good idea.
<LI> Perform any server-specific changes to each machine, eg change password
encryption from default SSHA to the more compatible CRYPT.

Solaris support the ldaplist command that does the equivalent of ypcat in the
NIS world.  It is easier than ldapsearch in the sense that it will use the 
BASEDN and ldapserver that is already configured for a given ldap client
machine.   If ldaplist work, then the client is correctly configured to talk 
to the ldap server (whereas ldapsearch just means the ldap server is
reachable).  It is probably tuned to work with the Sun One Directory Server, 
but many specific queries will work with RedHat/Fedora DS also.

<H6>/etc/security/user config details</H6>
the "default" clause should say something like:

<PRE class=cf>
default:
	SYSTEM = "LDAP or compat or DCE"
	(...)
</PRE>

This would allow local user account to be checked.  
If the order is "compat or LDAP", ldap user who telnet in will see a small error message about 
"invalid login name or password" and then move on to LDAP and log the user right in (assuming currect pam.conf).  If the order is "LDAP or compat", then somehow local user can still login even if there is matching USERNAME on LDAP with /bin/false for shell.  
IBM doc says DCE is used for X windows login, but seems to work w/o it anyway.  <BR>

Lastly, if somehow local user still doesn't work, then a specific clause for the
user need to be added, one that looks similar to the entry for the root user.  Either run commands like:  <BR>
chuser SYSTEM=compat db2inst8  <BR>
chuser SYSTEM=compat registry=files db2inst8  <BR>
(registry deal with where the password is stored.  For LDAP, it would be "registry=LDAP").
Alternatively, one can edit the file manually.  Final config should look like:  <BR>

<PRE class=cf>
db2inst8:
	SYSTEM = "compat"
	(...)
</PRE>

IBM claims that the extension, RFC2307AIX, provides additional support for AIX
5.2 onward.  It was supopsed to be a transparent addition that does not affect
other clients that do not use such feature.  The ldif file for schema
update is provided on AIX machines at /etc/security/ldap/nisSchema.ldif .
This extra support is not required, but provides AIX with additional user
tracking support.

This is the only book that I have found which covers native OS config to hook it up to LDAP
for basic user authentication.  It covers Solaris, Red Hat Linux, AIX and HP-UX.  
It is centered on the Sun Java System Directory Server, but it is largely the same as the 
Netscape/RedHat DS, so most tasks should be carriable over.  For the server config, it provides
steps of converting NIS data, SSL, Certificates, Replications, etc.<BR>

If you are a sys admin having to convert your heterogenous environment from NIS to LDAP, this 
book would be a necessity.  But be warned, this is NOT a comprehensive guide.  The book is very slim, 124 pages in all, with 41 figures and additional text-based output that cover most of the pages.  The author does take the admin on a step-by-step config for setting up the clients.  However, there are little explanations of what the different command does, or how to troubleshoot a problem which invariably will happen.  
<BR>

This book would server as a good reference for those admins who has already done the setup but need a quick guide to remind them of the detailed steps involved in each OS.  For those doing it a first time, the book would serve as an guide but more info would need to be digged out, yet there are no links or pointers from this book.   <BR>

Lastly, the book seems to have started as web-based documentation but now got it printed.  This isn't bad, but the table of contents have page numbering that is not quite accurate.  
Furthermore, the many screenshots in the book would be more meaningful if additional text are added to explain what was clicked to get to the view presented.

<A HREF="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/ldapsa/">
LDAP System Administration</A>.  Gerald Carter.  O'Reilly. ISBN 1565924916.  (c) 2003.<BR>
This book covers mostly the open source LDAP server, which lacks multi-master replication, thereby rendering of limited use in enterprise avoiding SPOF (but it does support simple replications).  It starts with concise technical overview of LDAPv3, then move on to describe how to create a simple OpenLDAP server to support a simple Directory.  It does cover some specifics of client config regarding pam_ldap, nss_ldap, OpenSSH, FTP, HTTP and email/MTA.  However, it lacks details on how to configure the very many OS when the admin is seeking to replace NIS, which works very well with the native telnet, rlogin, CDE, etc. 
<BR><BR>

<LI>Understanding and Deploying LDAP Directory Services, 2nd Ed.  Howes, Smith, Good.  ISBN 0672323168.  (c) 2003.<BR>
This book gives a comprehensive review of what LDAP is, what it can do, examples of deployment, and centered mainly the original Netscape DS.  Other than specific of the LDAP schema and LDIF fragments, a review of the Netscape DS in Ch 4, a good working overview of the replications in Ch 22, this book is largely high level business talk.  It doesn't have much details about any client connectivity, or the specifics on how to configure and maintain the Netscape DS.  The high level text that you need to do backup, have rigorous testing and go live plan, etc are of little relevance to the Sys Admin who is working on a commited project.  It concludes with a discussion of Perl Net::LDAP which would be very useful for scripting project after LDAP is established.
<BR><BR>

<LI>LDAP Directories Explained: An Introduction and Analysis.  Brian Arkills.  ISBN 020178792X.  (c) 2003.  <BR>
Again, high level book with little technical details.  Good starter guide as to what LDAP provides.  There are some rather theoretical details in the appendices, usable as a quick reference for LDAP Architect.  But limited use for Sys Admin.
<BR><BR>

<LI>Sun LDAP Blueprint. <BR>
This book cover only Sun's product.  The Sun DS discussion is probably applicable to the 
DS branded by other vendor, but the client OS config is solely on Solaris, and it has lot 
of intricacies used by itself.
