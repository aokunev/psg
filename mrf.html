This describes a Modified RAID Five algorithm intended for removable media such
as tape.

x-ref RFC 2549 - IP over Avian Carriers with Quality of Service


Applying RAID 5 technologies to removable media such as tape or DVD.


Overview Approach:

- Utilize multiple tape drives in parallel.  eg, 9 tape drives, for 8-bits byte
  + 1-bit parity checksum.
- Data written to all drives at the same time (ie in parallel).
- Data read from all drives at the same time.

Salient features when implemented in serial:
- High latency
- Low throughput
- High media utilization
- Data redundancy

Pivoted features when implemented in parallel:
- High throughput
- Minimized latency
- Improved failure tolerance


Technical Detail:
- Like Virtual Tape Library (VTL) and other disk-based backup, stage data to
  high speed random access media first(eg hard disk, SSD).  
- As data is written to disk, store them in data strucuture that imitate
  removable media such as tape.  ie, create tape images.  For 8+1 parity write
  in RAID 5, create 8 images, with 1 extra ready for parity data.  Stripe the
  write data across all 8 media images.  

- Calculate parity data.  Utilize first byte of all 8 tape images, calculate a
  parity byte.  Instead of calculating parity for each 8-bits of a byte,
  calculate it at the byte level.  This is what the algrithm is called
  "modified".  Write parity byte into extra parity tape image.

- Once it is time to move data to removable media, the images are copied to
  tape or DVD.  Ideally for faster performance they would be written in
  parallel, eg 9 drives at a time.  But serial write will be tolerated.  Middle
  of the ground, say, writting to 4 drives at a time is easily implemented as
  well, since it is just copying pre-caclulated images from fast random access
  media such as disk.

- Improvement is from read throughput (ie data restore).  All 8 or 9 removable
  media can be retrieved and read at the same time.  eg. A 240 GB restore/read
  would traditionally need to real more than a quarter of the tape in a 800 GB
  LTO4 media.  Using this MRF algorithm, all 9 tape drives will be fetched and
  read in 9 drives in paralle.  Since the data were stripped across all 8
  tapes, each tape only need to read 30 GB worth of data. 
- Furthermore, if one tape should fail, we can rely on the parity tape to
  restore the content.
- The 9th parity drive can be read at the same time of the 8-tape restore.
  This will avoid latency in case of failure actually needing the drive, and
  provide the peace of mind that data is indeed passing the parity checksum.

- Read/Restore would typically be staged to high speed random access media such
  as disk/ssd as well.


Future optimization:
- RAID 6 could be implemented to provide dual parity failure (eg failure of two
  tapes).


Analysis.
- Traditional redundancy for tape is often done by running an extra backup job
  to cut an extra set of tape.  
- For small backup/restore job, this amount to mirroring the data.
- Restore does NOT typically read from two tapes at the same time to provide a
  50% restore time improvement.

- For large job that span multiple tapes, extra backup job should be viewed as
  RAID 0 + 1 configuration of mirrored stripes on disk arrays.  
- Most likely, a dual media failure would render both set of backup tapes
  unusable.
- A better approach is to use what RAID 1 + 0 does, ie, mirror first, then
  apply stipping.  this has improved failure tolerance.  
- In the scenario of two set of backup tapes, if hit a failure, need to start
  all over from the second set.  
- Utilizing MRF algorithm, the read can be picked up from the parity media,
  potentially completely removing the "start over" time.

- In the same spirit, applying RAID technology to tape drives can improve
  failure tolerance.  For dual media failure, RAID 6 can be utilized (we can
  all this algorithm MRS - Modified RAID Six).  This will provide better dual
  tape failure recovery than cutting two sets of backup tapes.  


PS.  I first planned to publish this as an RFC, in the same spirit of the RFC
nnn for Pigeon Carrier for TCP packets.  

If you are stuck with Pigeon as carrier, implementing the RFC may be good.

Thus, if one is "stuck" with tape, then implementing this MRF algorithm maybe
good.  And, for organization that actually have the scale for it, it would
actually be advantageous.  To this date, tape has certain characteristics that
disk does not have.  

I have not formally submitted it as RFC, even if i do, i am sure the number
would not be 007.  This RFC was going to be submitted/published on April 1st.
But maybe as it stands, this may become a practical joke, emphasis on
practical.
