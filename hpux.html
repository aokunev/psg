<H1>HOW-TO</H1>

<H2>HP-UX 101</H2>


<PRE>
The default setup of HP-UX often "messes up" ^C and '@' symbol.
Default HP-UX /etc/profile map interrupt to "DEL" and kill to @.
This cause lot of confusion.  So, I recommend that you update your keyboard 
mapping once you get to a shell prompt:
	stty intr 
	stty kill 
	stty -a	# check your settings.

</PRE>


<H5>sam</H5>

<PRE>
Text User Interface (TUI) for sys config (GUI version avail if DISPLAY set to working X server).				
in /usr/sbin
SAM is your friend.  It should be the first place to try if you are admin from another OS :)
Not as good as aix smitty, but better than solaris that have nothing! 
Use TAB key to move around, space key for select.  Arrow key works.

--0--

some of the major files location:
/etc/hosts
/etc/nsswitch.conf
/etc/fstab
/etc/lvmconf/vgNN   (binary files, but see all volume grp here)
/sbin/rc.config.d/
/sbin/rc.d/

</PRE>

<H2>System Setup</H2>
<PRE>

***** Initial system install checklist:   *****


Ensure that / and /usr are fairly big, as these are not not expandable 
unless in single user mode (or maybe onlineJFS).
Most other volumes still need to be unmounted before fs can grow, 
so estimating correct size is pretty important.
OnlineJFS should allow fs expansion w/o unmount like AIX, but more money.




Get latest of all 4 of BUNDLE11i, HWEnable11i, GoldApp and GoldBase and install them. 
Factory OS install included the latest release of all the above 4 patch bundles.

After bundles, java patches may still be needed.  See:
http://www.hp.com/products1/unix/java/patches/index.html 

Upgrading OS.
Default CD media allow for both initial setup and upgrade.
Upgrade has special procedure to install lot of depot first when system still 
running.  riptide was upgraded from 11.00 to 11.11, seems to run fine.


--------------

Update HP-UX from 10x and 11.0 to 11i:
install update-ux software from CD, then run 
/usr/sbin/update-ux -s /cdrom HPUX11i-OE.

Refer to Install and update guide in "Instant Documentation" CD.

--
HP-UX versions
PA-RISC: 10.20 (EOL), 11.00 (11), 11.11 (11i),               11.23 (ca 2005/05)
Itanium:                                       11.20, 11.22, 11.23


<H2>Boot Time Troubleshooting</H2>

Recovery of unbootable system.
Default setup CD has option to do this.  It may help when 
VxFS has crashed some critical OS partitions.


booting  HP-UX machine into single user mode.

http://www.unixhub.com/docs/hpux/hpux_boot.html

(Connect dumb terminal to serial console)

Press and hold ESC at the beginning of the boot process 
(it should prompt, but if not, just hit ESC like crazy).

In the PDC (firmware processor dependent code), enter
BO to boot.  (or BO P0 isl), where P0 is the boot device to use,
whohwn by SEArch.

When it ask whether to use interactive ISL (initial system load), say yes.
a the ISL prompt, enter :
	hpux -is

	[ thre is a 'hpux -lm' for maintenance mode also 
	  it probably doesn't mount the / fs using normal method
	  and thus VxFS stuff will not work
	  -lm = lvm maint mode, sometime -is won't work when lvm is corrupted.
	  -lq = lvm, ignore failed mirror drive
		allow booting of machine when one of the mirrored drive
		have failed.
	  ll  = list content of /stand, thus see filename of alternate kernel
		usable via eg -lm /stand/vmunix.alternate
	]

After this, should see these messages and the login prompt:

Boot
: disk(scsi.6;0)/stand/vmunix
966616+397312+409688 start 0x6c50

   Kernel Startup Messages Omitted

INIT: Overriding default level with level 's'

INIT: SINGLE USER MODE
WARNING:  YOU ARE SUPERUSER!!
#

NOTE:  The VGA monitor + pc keyboard may show some optinos.
Hit F4 to toggle remote management on (with * on it).
This makes serial console usable.  


When booted in single user mode with corrupted fs,
vgchange can be used to tell Veritas Vol Mgrt which device to use.
This is sometime needed even in non-mirrored disk.
</PRE><!-- (eg ebbtide) --><PRE>
vgchange -a y /dev/vg00		
lvlnboot -v /dev/vg00

fsck -F vxfs -o full,nolog /dev/vg00/rvol8
		# fsck for drives that have lot of errors, this method
		# may give more instructions to cmd of how to do the cleaning.
		# by specifying -F vxfs, allow use of intent log (journaling) 			
		# feature of JFS and thus completes much quicker.



************************************************************
clear out attention light in front panel

thru serial console session:

^B , enter 2x
get into gsp mode (Guardian Service Processor cli)
	give access to bios level control of the machine, 
	view vfp (virtual front panel), clear hw err log, etc.

sl	# sys log

<H4>---------- PDC commands ----------</H4>

<PRE>

PDC - Processor Dependent Code
Accessed at boot up time by the hardware to boostrap the 
system.  Step 1 of booting.
Only accessible during boot time.
Need to hit any key when prompted in a 10 seconds windows
during boot process to enter the PDC interaction session.
The window is after all hardware has been checked and before 
OS bootstrab process begins.

SEA	Search and display bootable device.
	Booting from CDROM may need to use this to find 
	device path to use for booting.

BO		boot, use default dev
BO PRI		boot, using primary (default) dev
BO SEC		boot, using secondary disk.  Simple to do dual boot.
BO 0/0/2/1.15	boot via specific path, see SEA.

IN	enter info menu
  ALL	display all info, there will be machine model strings 
	to determin what class of machine it is.
	eg  9000/800/A500-5X System Name: riptide
	is A-class.  some software like compiler bound to the 800 designation.
	Class info usually not shown in tag/model info in front os system :(

  ME	memory info, tell which bank has what kind of DIMM, vacancy.


</PRE>
<H4> ---------- ISL commands ---------- </H4>

<PRE>

ISL - Initial System Loader
Invoked by PDC so that it can load the kernel off /stand 
from the hard drive.

Interactions in here allow boot into single user mode, etc.
See HOWTO section and hpux command is in ISL.

hpux -is			# single user mode.  No password req!!
hpux -lm			# LVM maintenance boot mode.
hpux -lm /stand/vmunix.prev	# boot via specific kernel 
hpux ll				# list kernels avai in /stand

<H4> ---------- GSP commands ---------- </H4>

<PRE>

GSP - Guardian Service Processor.
BIOS level command, accessible even when machine is 
in Power Off state.  

Use serial console or LAN console, 
hit ^B
default is unsecured so just press enter for username and
password to gain GSP> prompt access.
Accessible all the time, it will not cause any interruption of running system.
If machine gets into boot process, user session to GSP will end.

HE = help, LI in there list commands:

CO	return to console mode, exit GSP.  
	contrast to exit, which will logoff a telnet to the LAN console session.
LS, LC	Show and configure LAN console settings (IP, hostname, etc),
  	extremely useful, make sure to configure it!
TC	Send signal to OS, force it to do a core dump and reboot.
	Probably similar to Sun OBP sync cmd.
RS	Harshes restart of system, no OS interaction, no core.
	SUN OBM reset.
PC	allow turning machine on/off.  Can perform power cycle.
	GSP and LAN console will remain usable after power off.
	Contrast to SUN LOM and AIX serial access,
	just need to have power fed into machine.
PS	Monitor status of power supply, fan, etc.

SL	Show log, GSP level logging, with timestamp in UTC/GMT.
	Use this command to clear attention light.
CL	Show text message that has been displayed to the console.

VFP	display a virtual front panel, a mirror of the LED in front of machine.

<H2>Random Daily Tasks</H2>

<PRE>





changing hostname of a machine

/etc/rc.config.d/netconf	# top, see HOSTNAME="name"
/etc/hosts
/var/adm/inetd.sec		# may not be needed.

hostname NEWNAME (use this instead of reboot)

don't use set_parm
sam okay, but check files above.



move machine to new subnet, maybe use sam instead of config file changes for IP/NIC settings or else
need to edit multiple places.



creating /dev/zero

cd /dev
mknod zero c 3 0x000004
chown bin:sys zero
chmod 666 zero


Change system default timezone:
edit /etc/TIMEZONE to be:
TZ=PST8PDT
export TZ



Setting up NIS with predefinied list of servers.

/etc/rc.config.d/nameserver ::
NIS_DOMAIN-"titaniumleg.com"
(verify with domainname, immediate activation via domainname titaniumleg.com)

lvcreate -C y -r n -L 1024 /dev/vg01	# ditto, will be named lvol2 automatically

lvlnboot -r /dev/vg01/lvol1		# make lvol1 a boot partition
lvlnboot -s /dev/vg01/lvol2		# make lvol2 a swap dev


newfs -F vxfs /dev/vg01/rlvol1		# create the fs as veritas fs
swapon /dev/vg01/lvol2			# activate swap
vi /etc/fstab...

# swap addition like this req disk to have a boot partition, even on 2nd disk.
# sam may provide easier alternative.
# also, may need to set kernel param maxswapchunk which limit max swap size in byte
# calc as swchunk * DEV_BSIZE, whose def are 2048 and 1024, resp.



non "system" volumes can be created as, eg /usr/local:
lvcreate /dev/vg00	
lvextend -L 2000 /dev/vg00/lvol11 	# allocate 2 GB for the Log Vol.
newfs -F vxfs /dev/vg00/rlvol11		# lvol11 assigned dyn from above

Clean up procedure, reverse of create...
lvrmboot -r /dev/vg01			# remove root vol req for the LV.
					# undo lvlnboot -r and -s
lvremove /dev/vg01/lvol2		# remove the logic vol lvol2 from vg01
lvremove /dev/vg01/lvol1
vgremove vg				# remove the whole vol grp

bdf					# df, berkeley version

growfing the fs:
lvdisplay /dev/vg00/lvolX
# find out LE value
umount /fsmount
lvextend -l le_number /dev/vg00/lvolX	# where le_number is new LE value
					# or -L sizeInMB (final size)
extendfs  /dev/vg00/lvolX		# will fill up all allocated LE, JFS
fsadm -F vxfs size /fsmount		# increase fs for onlineJFS.
mount /fsmount

unless have onlineJFS, need unmount before extend.  /var, /usr need boot into 
single user mode (ISL hpux -is, -lm main mode won't work!)
lvextend, extendfs, then reboot to increase such fs.
Not sure how to do / !!

<A NAME="OVMC"></A>
<H3>Other Volume Management Commands</H3>

HP-UX >= 11  default boot disk is under control of LVM - Logical Volume Manager.

<A ID="Note-lvm"></A>
<DIV class="note">
<I>Note</I><BR />
HP-UX shipws with <B>TWO</B> LVM.  An native version for core OS partitions, and 
Veritas Volume Manager for use with data partitions. <!--(hp book)-->
Filesystem created by LVM can be hfs (/stand, boot stuff) and vxfs (root, /var, /usr, etc).
Further note that in addition to vxfs, HP talks about JFS and onlineJFS, see fsck. <BR>
To some extend, this is akin to Solaris, whereby some admin use the Sun Volume Manager (Disk Suite) 
for OS disks, and Veritas for data disks.  HP-UX just happen to ship both pre-installed.

automount typical auto startup (from ps):
/usr/lib/netsvc/fs/automount/automount -f /etc/auto_master -D ARCH=SC_HPUX	# old automount
/usr/lib/netsvc/fs/autofs/automountd -D ARCH=SC_HPUX				# newer autofs, /net may need some OS path in PARISC

/etc/rc.config.d/nfsconf				# set both to be sure!	
	AUTO_OPTIONS="-f $AUTO_MASTER -D ARCH=SC_HPUX"	#older automount
	AUTOMOUNTD_OPTIONS="-D ARCH=SC_HPUX"		#newer autofs
	see sambple config in hpux/nfsconf

/sbin/init.d/nfs.client	start 		# automount/autofs, can read the std out from this script

startup file is in /sbin/init.d/nfs.client

Note that if NIS map auto.master use undescore like auto_home, 
hpux won't be able to translate that to auto.home
As such, a slew of files need to be added in /etc/auto_home with conent of
+auto.home

/etc/auto.products		:: 	+auto.products
/etc/auto.automnt		::	+auto.automnt

Converting NIS server to have map with '.' should work.
But afraid break other OS platform, not well tested yet.
But Ohio NIS use that and it works fine!
Ass hole before created the SNAFU for me.

For compatibility issues, it is probably best to avoid both . and _ in the filename
There should not be reason why one can't use auto_master to have entries like:
/products 	autoproducts	# ie, no . or _

Not sure of the effect on auto_home and auto_direct

	# remember to add the card interface eg lan0 in the name

	# can also change settings via lanadmin -X 100fd 
	# but it will not live thru reboot.

change DNS servers
/etc/resolv.conf		# same as solaris/aix.
sam, networking and communications, DNS (BIND), DNS Resolver
use Menu, Actions, Set Default Domain...  to add "search" for other dns domains.  
config file edit is easier, only 1 file.

change ip/netmask:
sam, networking and communications, network interface cards
# this even allow for speed duplex settings!!  Advance has mac address and mtu.
/etc/rc.config.d/netconf 	# IP_ADDRESS[0]="10.10.10.123" SUBNET_MASK[0] 
				# BROADCAST_ADDRESS[0]="" (blank seems to work, auto calc?)
/etc/hosts 			# enter new IP of machine.

change routing:
sam, networking and communications, routes
/etc/rc.config.d/netconf	# ROUTE_DESTINATION[0]="default"
				# ROUTE_MASK[0]=""
				# ROUTE_GATEWAY[0]="10.10.10.1"	
				# ROUTE_COUNT[0]="1"		(aix consider it as 0)

swlist -l product 	
	list all product/patches in system
swlist | grep -e QPK -e GOLD
	determine if any Quality Pack or Gold Base patch has been installed 
	(service pack equiv).
	Apperently, all 4 of BUNDLE11i, HWEnable11i, GoldApp and GoldBase should be installed on the system.
	Factory OS install included the latest release of all the above 4 patch bundles.
swlist -l product | grep PH
	look for installed patches.  -l product seems to be needed for 11i 


swinstall -f mysoft -s /mnt/cd
	supposed to install software listed in file mysoft from cdrom

swinstall -s /home/sa/share/software-in-cd/hpux_aC++/aC++Compiler.800.depot
	needed to fully specify the depot file before the damn thing will recognize the file.  It is really just a tar file.

swinstall -s /export/tmp/bash.depot \*
	install everything in the depot (in this case, sure there is bash only).
	
	see email about where gnu tools are downloaded 
	[http://hpux.cs.utah.edu, depot format, some ins to /usr/local/bin,

<H2>Patch</H2>

<PRE>

patch install eg:
(patch is obtained in a "depot" file format, which is really a tar.  
Instruction presented in here is also in a text file inside the tar.)

http://www2.itrc.hp.com/service/patch/patchDetail.do?patchid=PHSS_20055&context=hpux:800:11:00

	1. Back up your system before installing a patch.

	2. Login as root.

	3. Copy the patch to the /tmp directory.

	4. Move to the /tmp directory and unshar the patch:

		cd /tmp
		sh PHSS_20055

	5. Run swinstall to install the patch:

[ to check that depot has been downloaded correctly:
  swlist -d @ /full/absolute/path/PHSS_20055.depot
]

		swinstall -x autoreboot=true -x patch_match_target=true \
			  -s /tmp/PHSS_20055.depot

	By default swinstall will archive the original software in
	/var/adm/sw/save/PHSS_20055.  If you do not wish to retain a
	copy of the original software, use the patch_save_files option:

		swinstall -x autoreboot=true -x patch_match_target=true \
			  -x patch_save_files=false -s /tmp/PHSS_20055.depot

	WARNING: If patch_save_files is false when a patch is installed,
		 the patch cannot be deinstalled.  Please be careful
		 when using this feature.

	For future reference, the contents of the PHSS_20055.text file is
	available in the product readme:

		swlist -l product -a readme -d @ /tmp/PHSS_20055.depot

	To put this patch on a magnetic tape and install from the
	tape drive, use the command:

		dd if=/tmp/PHSS_20055.depot of=/dev/rmt/0m bs=2k

maxusers	# num of users, base param as multiplier by other params
		# does not actually govern logins.

npty		# pty for user login sessions.
nstrpty		# can set them to 1000
nstrtel

nproc		# max processes that can exist on system, 11i = static
		# def 20 + 8 * MAXUSERS (5988?)

use sam to define new params and build new kernel.
restart is needed.

Kernel parameters in default os is not very good for large server,
For large java app servers, get HP tool Java2 Out-of-box
and it will plug in all desireble parameters.  Probably good for all server.

download .depot, swinstal -s /full/path/to/joob_203_1100.depot -x autoreboot=true \*
Req reboot.  
/usr/sbin/kmtune will display the kernel params.  It should modify:
maxusers 512

<H2>Adding International Language/Locale support</H2>

<PRE>
By default, all the basic support for international language are
installed.  Check with "locale -a".

The CDE language may need to be installed manually:
Insert CD2 of HP-UX 11i Foundation Operating Environment, then 
run SAM Software Install and add the CDE bundle of the desired language.

</PRE>


<H2>Hardware commands</H2>

model	- give machine model info

<H2>Diagnostic tools</H2>
<PRE>
diagnostics tools:

netfmt -(lot of options) /var/adm/nettl.LOGnnn > /tmp/nettl.txt
	convert the network problem log from binary to text
	options may have been -l -N -n -f


stm, cstm xstm		
	hardware diagnostic program.  text menu, cli and X based.
	probably not well known, support people use only?

tusk
	some sort of network troubleshooting util.

</PRE>

<H1> Random Stuff </H1>
For those from Solaris background:

<PRE>
Env variables:
SHLIB_PATH			is used instead of Solaris LD_LIBRARY_PATH
LD_LIBRARY_PATH		for 64 bit version libs.  Solaris LD_LIBRARY_PATH64
LIB		There maybe something about the env var also.  Not sure.


dos2unix	
	Couldn't find such command tool, only found charconv.

charconv 
	convert input file to desired output format
	-u = unix  LF
	-d = dos   CRLF
	-m = mac   CR
	-i inputfile,  default is std in
	-o outputfile, default to std out
	--help more conversion info, including EBCDIC
	eg: cat dostext.txt | charconv -u > unixoutput.txt


Compiler:
	The bundled cc compiler in /usr/ccs/bin/cc_bundled only takes K&R function prototype syntax, not Ansi C.
	Moneyware aCC is Ansi C compliant and installs to /opt/aCC.

<H3>HP-UX Freeware</H3>
<pre>

Info about installing hpux gnu freeware from hpux.cs.utah.edu. into NFS server central location.
No real need to use SAM to install the package and xfer to NFS server.
Can just do tar trick, see note below.  Warning: Some admin may see this as kludge as 
it bypass the software management tool.  Your choice :)

/import/hpux1100/usr/local$ cat dir.info

This dir is automounted as /import/hpux1100/usr/local
Various link would exist pointing to the parent dir of /import/hpux1100, such as /titaniumlegit.  
It could also be a symlink from slightly diff version of HP-UX 11.x


These files are gnu freeware depot files for HP-UX 11.00 from hpux.cs.utah.edu

The source is netapp:/vol/vol1/depot/hpux1100/usr/local  

The source depot files are hacked via untar and set of cp commands to put them into the desired 
usr/local/bin etc tree structure:

gunzip *.tar
mkdir untared
cd untared
for item in `ls ../*.depot`; do
        tar xf $item
done

mkdir -p cleaned/usr
cp -pR  */*/usr/* cleaned/usr

and finally the cleanred/usr/local dir is moved here.


---

the opt dir is extracted in similar manner:

mkdir -p cleaned/opt
cp -pR */*/opt/*/* cleaned/opt/
