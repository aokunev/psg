<H2><A NAME="1020025"></A>Resources</H2>

<P><A NAME="1020073"></A>A computer network may be thought of as a collection
of resources used to execute programs. Different applications often require
different resources. For example, a market simulation program may take
a lot of CPU power, whereas a large database application may need a lot
of memory to run well. If the machines in the network are of different
types, certain applications may run on some of them, but not on others.</P>

<P><A NAME="1020076"></A>To run applications quickly and correctly, resource
requirements can be used. Resource requirements are strings that contain
resource names and operators. There are several types of resources. <I>Load
indices</I> measure dynamic resource availability, such as a server's CPU
load or available swap space. <I>Static resources</I> represent unchanging
information, such as the number of CPUs a host has, the host type, and
the maximum available swap space.</P>

<P><A NAME="1020082"></A>Resources can have numeric, string, or boolean
(logical) values. Memory, swap space and CPU load are examples of resources
with numeric values. Host type and model are string resources. Boolean
resources are static resources assigned by the JobScheduler administrator
to represent features available on particular hosts such as the availability
of host-locked software licences or special hardware.</P>

<P><A NAME="1020083"></A>The <TT>lsinfo</TT> command lists the resources
available in your cluster. See the example listing in <A HREF="5-environment.html#1022186">'Cluster
Resource Information'</A>. Resource names are case sensitive.</P>

<H3><A NAME="1020091"></A>Resource Requirements</H3>

<P><A NAME="1020027"></A>A resource requirement string is divided into
three sections, including a selection section, an ordering section, and
a resource usage section.The selection string specifies the characteristics
a host must have to be considered eligible. The ordering section indicates
how the hosts that meet the selection criteria should be sorted. The resource
usage section specifies the expected resource consumption of the task.
The syntax of a resource requirement string is:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1021936"></A>select[selectstring] order[orderstring] rusage[usagestring]</PRE>

<P><A NAME="1021938"></A>where '<TT>select</TT>', '<TT>order</TT>' and
'<TT>rusage</TT>' are the section names. The selection string is a logical
expression built from a set of resource names. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="1021991"></A><B>Note<BR>
</B><I>The '</I><TT>select</TT><I>' keyword may be omitted if the '</I><TT>selectstring</TT><I>'
appears as the first string in the resource requirement. </I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="1021967"></A>The order string allows the selected hosts to
be sorted according to the value(s) of resource(s). The syntax of the order
string is:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1021969"></A>&quot;[-]res:[-]res:...[-]res&quot;</PRE>

<P><A NAME="1021972"></A>where each '<TT>res</TT>' is a load index resource
name, as is returned from the <TT>lsload</TT> command. The order string
is used as input to a multi-level sorting algorithm, where each sorting
phase orders the hosts according to one particular load index and discards
some hosts. The remaining hosts are passed onto the next phase. The first
phase begins with the last index and proceeds from right to left. </P>

<P><A NAME="1021987"></A>The <TT>usagestring</TT> specifies the expected
resource usage of the job. This is used for resource reservation so that
JobScheduler would reserve the specified resources for the job to not overcommit
resources to other jobs. See <A HREF="8-advanced.html#1022013">'Resource
Reservation'</A> for details. </P>

<P><A NAME="1021927"></A>If you need to explicitly specify resource requirements
for your job, use the <TT>-R</TT> option to the <TT>bsub</TT> command.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1020028"></A>% <B>bsub -R &quot;mem &gt;= 5 &amp;&amp; solaris order[cpu]&quot; command</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1020029"></A>The above example requests your job runs on a
Solaris host that has a lightly loaded CPU and at least 5 megabytes of
memory available.</P>

<P><A NAME="1020033"></A>You do not have to specify resource requirements
every time you submit a job. JobScheduler maintains a task resource list
that is consulted automatically to get the resource requirements of a job.
The task list is initially configured by your cluster administrator. To
view the task list, use <TT>lsrtasks</TT> command:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1021904"></A>% <B>lsrtasks
</B>lotus123/type==solaris 
eval/type==any &amp;&amp; swp&gt;40
weekly_report/hname==hostD
backup/fserver</PRE>

<P><A NAME="1021911"></A>Each line of the output associates a resource
requirement expression with a task name. When you submit a job to JobScheduler,
the first string from your command line (the command name) is used as the
task name to consult the task list to find the resource requirements of
the task. </P>

<P><A NAME="1021914"></A>If a resource requirement string is not given
for a task, the default resource requirement string <TT>&quot;type==$host_type
order[r15s:pg]&quot;</TT> is assumed, where <I>host_type</I> refers to
the host type of the job submission host. </P>

<H3><A NAME="1020043"></A>Resource Limits</H3>

<P><A NAME="1020045"></A>Most UNIX systems allow you to limit some of the
resources consumed by a job. Jobs that consume more than the specified
amount of a resource are signalled or have their priority lowered. Not
all limits are supported on all systems, and the exact behaviour is system
specific. See the <TT>setrlimit(2)</TT> manual page for details on how
each system implements resource limits.</P>

<P><A NAME="1020046"></A>Queues can also specify resource limits for jobs
in the queue. If both the queue and the <TT>bsub</TT> command specify a
limit, the job is given the most restrictive limit.</P>

<P><A NAME="1020047"></A>The following resource limits can be specified
to <TT>bsub</TT>:</P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="1020048"></A><TT>-c <I>cpu_limit</I>[/<I>host_spec</I>] </TT></DT>

<DD>Limit this job to using only <I>cpu_limit</I> of time on the execution
host. You specify the limit with the syntax <TT>[</TT>hour:<TT>]</TT>minute
(minute can be greater than 59). If you supply a <I>host_spec</I>, the
limit is scaled by the appropriate CPU scaling factor. This option is useful
for preventing an erroneous job from running for an excessive amount of
time. </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="1021182"></A><TT>-W <I>run_limit</I>[/<I>host_spec</I>] </TT></DT>

<DD>Limit this job to using only <I>run_limit</I> of wall clock time. If
it exceeds the limit, it is given a warning and then terminated 10 minutes
later. </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="1021183"></A><TT><I>-F file_limit</I> </TT></DT>

<DD>If this job attempts to write to a file such that the file size would
increase beyond <I>file_limit</I> kilobytes, it is sent a warning (that
normally causes the process to terminate). </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="1021184"></A><TT>-D <I>data_limit</I> </TT></DT>

<DD>Limit the size of the data segment of a job to <I>data_limit</I> kilobytes.
If the job attempts to acquire more memory, it receives an error. This
option would not normally be of interest to JobScheduler users. </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="1021185"></A><TT>-S <I>stack_limit</I> </TT></DT>

<DD>Limit the stack segment size limit for this job. An attempt to extend
the stack beyond <I>stack_limit</I> kilobytes causes the job to be terminated.
This option would not normally be of interest to JobScheduler users. </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="1021251"></A><TT>-C <I>core_limit</I> </TT></DT>

<DD>Limit this job to a core file size of <I>core_limit</I> kilobytes.
This option would not normally be of interest to JobScheduler users. </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="1021252"></A><TT>-M <I>mem_limit</I> </TT></DT>

<DD>Limit the process resident set size limit to <I>mem_limit</I> kilobytes
for this batch job. This option would not normally be of interest to JobScheduler
users. </DD>
</DL>

<P><A NAME="1021282"></A>The following examples specify that your job can
run for 3.5 hours. The first example uses the syntax <I>hour:minute</I>,
the second uses <I>minute</I> only.</P>

</B>% <B>bsub -c 210 -J 3.5Hours command</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1020050"></A>The following example specifies that your job
can use 10 minutes of run time on a DEC3100 host, or the corresponding
time on any other host.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1021123"></A>% <B>bsub -c 10/DEC3100 -J TenMinJob command</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1021284"></A>In the following example, your job can use 4 hours
of wall clock time. If it is still running 4 hours later, it will be warned
and then terminated after another 10 minutes.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1021285"></A>% <B>bsub -W 4:00 -J FourHours command</B></PRE>

<H2><A NAME="1020013"></A>File Transfer</H2>

<P><A NAME="1020158"></A>The JobScheduler is normally used in networks
with shared file space. When shared file space is not available, JobScheduler
can copy needed files to the execution host before running the job, then
copy resultant files back to the submission host after the job completes.</P>

<P><A NAME="1020159"></A>The <TT>bsub</TT> command has the <TT>-f &quot;[<I>lfile
op</I> [<I>rfile</I>]]&quot;</TT> option, which copies a file between the
submission host and the execution host.</P>

<P><A NAME="1021328"></A><I>lfile</I> (local file) is the file name on
the submission host, and <I>rfile</I> (remote file) is the name on the
execution host. <I>lfile</I> and <I>rfile</I> can be specified with absolute
or relative path names. If you do not specify one of the files, <TT>bsub</TT>
uses the filename of the other. At least one must be given.</P>

<P><A NAME="1021325"></A><I>op</I> is the operation to perform on the file.
<I>op</I> must be surrounded by white space. <I>op</I> is invalid without
at least one of <I>lfile</I> or <I>rfile</I>. The possible values for <I>op</I>
are:</P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="1020162"></A><TT>&gt;</TT></DT>

<DD><I>lfile</I> on the submission host is copied to <I>rfile</I> on the

</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="1020165"></A><TT>&gt;&lt;, &lt;&gt;</TT></DT>

<DD><I>lfile</I> is copied to <I>rfile</I> before the job executes, then
<I>rfile</I> is copied back (replacing the previous <I>lfile</I>) after
the job completes (<TT>&lt;&gt;</TT> is the same as <TT>&gt;&lt;</TT>).
</DD>
</DL>

<P><A NAME="1021400"></A>To run the job <TT>update</TT>, which updates
the data file in place, you need to copy the file to the execution host
before the job runs and copy it back after the job completes.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1021401"></A>% <B>bsub -f &quot;data &lt;&gt;&quot; update data</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1021310"></A>The <TT>-f</TT> option may be repeated to specify
multiple files.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1021403"></A>% <B>bsub -f &quot;data1 &gt;&quot; -f &quot;out1 &lt;&quot; command data1</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1021410"></A>In the above example, the file <I>data1</I> will
be copied to the execution host before running the job. The resultant file,
<I>out1</I>, will be copied back to the submission host after the job completes.
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="1021420"></A><B>Note<BR>
</B><I>The files being copied to and from the execution host may also need
to appear on the command line of the job.</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="1020166"></A>If you specified an input file with the <TT>-i</TT>
option (see <A HREF="6-job-define.html#1021104">'Input and Output'</A>)
and it is not found on the execution host, the file is copied from the
submission host using the JobScheduler remote file access facility. It
is removed from the execution host after the job finishes.</P>

<P><A NAME="1020167"></A>If you specified output files with the <TT>-o</TT>
(standard output) and <TT>-e</TT> (standard error) options, these files
are created on the execution host. They are not copied back to the submission
host by default. You must explicitly copy these files back to the submission
host. The following command stores the job output in the <I>job_out</I>
file and copies the file back to the submission host.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1020168"></A>% <B>bsub -o job_out -f 'job_out &lt;' command</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1021375"></A>JobScheduler tries to change directories to the
same path name as the directory where you ran the <TT>bsub</TT> command.
If this directory does not exist, the job is run in the temporary directory
on the execution host.</P>

<P><A NAME="1021391"></A>If the submission and execution hosts have different
directory structures, you must ensure that the directory where <I>rfile</I>
will be placed exists. You should always specify it with relative path
names, preferably as a file name excluding any path. This places <I>rfile</I>
in the current working directory of the job. The job will work correctly
even if the directory where the <TT>bsub</TT> command is run does not exist
on the execution host.</P>

<P><A NAME="1021395"></A>In the following example, you submit a job with
input taken from the file <TT>/data/data3</TT> and the output copied back
to <TT>/data/out3</TT>.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1021364"></A>% <B>bsub -f &quot;/data/data3 &gt; data3&quot; -f &quot;/data/out3 &lt; out3&quot; command data3 out3</B></PRE>

<H2><A NAME="1020494"></A>Start and Termination Time</H2>

<P><A NAME="1020496"></A>You can control the times when your job is dispatched
by associating it with a calendar. You can also specify a start and termination
time using the <TT>-b</TT> and <TT>-t</TT> options to the <TT>bsub</TT>
command.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1020497"></A>% <B>bsub -b 5:00 command</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1020501"></A>The submitted job remains pending until after
5 a.m. local time on the JobScheduler master host.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1020502"></A>% <B>bsub -b 11:12:5:40 -t 11:12:20:30 command</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1020503"></A>The above command submits your job to start after
November 12 05:40:00. If the job is still running on November 12 at 20:30:00,
it is killed.</P>

<H2><A NAME="1020575"></A>Reinitializing the Job Environment</H2>

<P><A NAME="1020577"></A>By default JobScheduler copies the environment
of the job from the submission host when the job is submitted. The environment
is recreated on the execution host when the job is started. This is convenient
in many cases because the job runs as if it had been run interactively
on the submission host. </P>

<P><A NAME="1021444"></A>There are cases where you want to use a platform
or host specific environment to run the job, rather than the same environment
as on the submission host. For example, you may want to set up different
search paths on the execution host. The <TT>-L <I>login_shell</I></TT>
option causes <TT>bsub</TT> to emulate a login on the execution host before
starting the user job. This makes sure that the startup files (<TT>.profile</TT>
for <TT>/bin/sh</TT>, or <TT>.cshrc</TT> and <TT>.login</TT> for <TT>/bin/csh</TT>)
are sourced before the job is started. The <I>shell</I> argument specifies
the login shell to use to reinitialize the environment.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1020581"></A>% <B>bsub -L /usr/local/shell command</B></PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="1020583"></A><B>Note<BR>
</B><I>This is not the shell under which the job will be executed. When
a login shell is specified with the </I><TT>-L</TT><I> option, that shell
is only used to set the environment. The job is run using </I><TT>/bin/sh</TT><I>,
unless the user specifies otherwise (see <A HREF="8-advanced.html#1020631">'Running
a Job Under a Particular Shell' </A>).</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><A NAME="1021797"></A>Exclusive Jobs</H2>

<P><A NAME="1021799"></A>You can submit a job requesting that it must run
exclusively on a host. Use the <TT>-x</TT> option to the <TT>bsub</TT>
command.</P>

<P><A NAME="1021803"></A>The job is started on a host that has no other
JobScheduler jobs running on it. The host is locked while this job is running,
so that no other jobs are sent to it until the exclusive job finishes.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1021807"></A>% <B>bsub -x -J Exclusive command</B></PRE>

<H2><A NAME="1020611"></A>Job Scripts</H2>

<P><A NAME="1020612"></A>If <TT>bsub</TT> is run without giving a command
to submit, it reads job command lines from the standard input. If the standard
input is a controlling terminal, then you are prompted with <TT>bsub&gt;</TT>
for each line.</P>

<H3><A NAME="1020617"></A>Embedded Submission Options</H3>

<P><A NAME="1020618"></A>You can specify job submission options in the

<P><A NAME="1020620"></A>There are a few things to note:</P>

<UL>
<LI><A NAME="1020621"></A>Command line options override embedded options,

<P><A NAME="1020626"></A>The <I>shell_script</I> file contains job submission
options (lines starting with '<TT>#BSUB</TT>') as well as command lines
to execute. When the <TT>bsub</TT> command reads a script from its standard

you can modify the script after <TT>bsub</TT> returns without affecting
the current submission.</P>

<P><A NAME="1021601"></A>When the script is specified on the <TT>bsub</TT>

</B>Job &lt;1240&gt; submitted to default queue &lt;default&gt;.</PRE>

<P><A NAME="1020628"></A>In this case the shell script is spooled by JobScheduler,
instead of the contents of the <I>shell_script</I> file. If you subsequently
change the script, the behaviour of your job may also change. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="1020629"></A><B>Note<BR>

<P><A NAME="1022052"></A>By default, job scheduling is based on current
load conditions. In this case, it is assumed that the resources a job consumes
will be reflected in the load information. However, many jobs do not consume
all of the resources they require when they first start. For example, a
job requiring 100MB of swap is dispatched to a host having 150MB of available
swap. The job starts off initially allocating 5MB and gradually increases
the amount consumed to 100MB over a period of 30 minutes. During this period,
another job requiring more than 50MB of swap should not be started on the
same host to avoid overcommitting swap. </P>

<P><A NAME="1022059"></A>Resources can be reserved as specified by a job's
resource requirements or configured with queues. If resources are reserved,
no other job will use the resources, even if the job for which the resources
have been reserved has not consumed them. The syntax for resource reservation
in the <TT>rusage</TT> section of resource requirement string is:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1022064"></A>res=value[:res=value]...[:res=value][:duration=value][:decay=value]</PRE>

<P><A NAME="1022066"></A>Here '<TT>res</TT>' can be any load index and
'<TT>value</TT>' is the initial reserved amount. If '<TT>res</TT>' or '<TT>value</TT>'
is not given, the default is to not reserve that resource. '<TT>duration</TT>'
is the time period within which the specified resources should be reserved.
If '<TT>duration</TT>' is not specified then the default is to reserve
the total amount for the lifetime of the job. </P>

<P><A NAME="1022072"></A>The '<TT>decay</TT>' parameter indicates how the
reserved amount should decrease over the duration. A value of 1 for '<TT>decay</TT>'
(for example, '<TT>decay=1</TT>') indicates that the system should linearly
decrease the amount reserved over the duration. The default decay value
is 0, which causes the total amount to be reserved for the lifetime of
the job. The decay parameter is ignored if the duration is not specified.
Values other than 0 or 1 for this parameter are unsupported. </P>

<P><A NAME="1022218"></A>When deciding whether to schedule a job on a host
, the JobScheduler system considers the reserved resources of all the jobs
that have been started on that host. For each load index, the amount reserved
by all jobs on that host is summed up and deducted from the current value
of the resources as reported by <TT>lsload(1)</TT> to get the amount available
for scheduling new jobs:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1022226"></A>available amount = current value - reserved amount for all jobs</PRE>

<P><A NAME="1022246"></A>Reservation of the resources '<TT>mem</TT>' and
'<TT>swap</TT>' are handled as special cases. For these resources, the
run time usage is used to determine the amount to reserve. The reserved
amount is the specified amount minus the run time usage. The '<TT>duration</TT>'
and '<TT>decay</TT>' parameters are ignored for these resources.</P>

<P><A NAME="1022231"></A>For example:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1022232"></A>% <B>bsub -R &quot;rusage[swap=50]&quot; my_job</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1022233"></A>will reserve 50 megabytes of swap for the job.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1022234"></A>% <B>bsub -R &quot;rusage[tmp=30:duration=30:decay=1]&quot; my_job</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1022235"></A>will reserve 30 megabytes of <TT>/tmp</TT> space
for the job. As the job runs, the amount reserved will decrease at approximately
1 megabyte/minute such that the reserved amount is 0 after 30 minutes.</P>
