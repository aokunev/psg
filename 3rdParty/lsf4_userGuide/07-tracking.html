<P><A NAME="2896"></A>The <TT>-a</TT> option displays jobs that completed
or exited in the recent past, along with pending and running jobs.</P>

<P><A NAME="15751"></A>The <TT>-r</TT> option displays only running jobs.</P>

<P><A NAME="2898"></A>The <TT>-u <I>username</I></TT> option displays jobs
submitted by other users. The special user name <TT>all</TT> displays jobs
submitted by all users.</P>

<P><A NAME="16319"></A>For example, to find out who is running jobs on
which hosts enter:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="2899"></A><TT>% <B>bjobs -u all</B></TT></PRE>

<P><A NAME="2902"></A>You can also find jobs on specific queues or hosts,
find jobs submitted by specific projects, and check the status of specific
jobs using their job IDs or names. See the <TT>bjobs(1)</TT> manual page
for more information.</P>

<H2><A NAME="15229"></A>Finding Pending or Suspension Reasons</H2>

<P><A NAME="15233"></A>When you submit a job to LSF Batch, it may be held
in the queue before it starts running and it may be suspended while running.
The <TT>-p</TT> option to the <TT>bjobs</TT> command displays the reasons
a job is pending. Because there can be more than one reason the job is
pending or suspended, all reasons that contributed to the pending or suspension
are reported. For example:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="15445"></A>% <B>bjobs -p
</B>7678  user1    PEND  priority    hostD         verilog           Oct 28 13:08
Queue's resource requirements not satisfied:3 hosts;
Unable to reach slave lsbatch server: 1 host;
Not enough job slots: 1 host;</PRE>

<P><A NAME="15434"></A>The pending reasons will also mention the number
of hosts for each condition. To get the specific host names, along with
pending reasons, use the <TT>-p</TT> and <TT>-l</TT> options to the <TT>bjobs</TT>
command. For example:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="15467"></A>% <B>bjobs -lp
</B>Job Id &lt;7678&gt;, User &lt;user1&gt;, Project &lt;default&gt;, Status &lt;PEND&gt;, Queue &lt;priority&gt;

</B><I>In a cluster with many hosts (100-200 hosts), it may be too verbose
or considered unnecessary to always show the host names with the pending
reasons. Therefore, use the </I><TT>bjobs</TT><I> command with the </I><TT>-p</TT><I>
option only.</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="15649"></A>The <TT>-l</TT> option to the <TT>bjobs</TT> command
displays detailed information about job status and parameters, such as
the job's current working directory, parameters specified when the job
was submitted, and the time when the job started running.</P>

Mon Oct 28 13:08:11:Submitted from host &lt;hostD&gt;,CWD &lt;$HOME&gt;, Requested 
Resources &lt;type==any &amp;&amp; swp&gt;35&gt;;

PENDING REASONS:
Queue's resource requirements not satisfied:3 hosts;
Unable to reach slave lsbatch server: 1 host;
Not enough job slots: 1 host;

 SCHEDULING PARAMETERS:
           r15s   r1m  r15m   ut      pg    io   ls    it    tmp    swp    mem 
 loadSched   -    0.7   1.0    -      4.0    -    -     -     -      -      -

<P><A NAME="15651"></A>The <TT>loadSched</TT> and <TT>loadStop</TT> thresholds
displayed are those that apply to this job. If the job is pending, the
thresholds are taken from the queue. If the job has been dispatched, each
threshold is the more restrictive of the queue and execution host thresholds
for that load index.</P>

<P><A NAME="15795"></A>Scheduling is also affected by other queue constraints
such as <TT>RES_REQ</TT>, <TT>STOP_COND</TT>, <TT>RESUME_COND</TT>, fairshare
policy, and others.</P>

<P><A NAME="15482"></A>The <TT>-s</TT> option displays the reasons a batch
job was suspended. Because the load conditions are constantly changing,
the reasons for suspension may be out of date. Once the job is suspended
it does not resume execution until its scheduling conditions are met.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="4911"></A>% <B>bjobs -s
</B>JOBID USER     STAT  QUEUE      FROM_HOST   EXEC_HOST   JOB_NAME   SUBMIT_TIME
605   user1    SSUSP idle       hostQ         hostC     Test4      Oct 17 18:07
The host load exceeded the following threshold(s):
Paging rate: pg;
Idle time: it;</PRE>

<P><A NAME="2909"></A>In the example above, the job was suspended because
the paging rate and interactive idle time on the execution host went above
the suspending threshold. Even though the paging rate may have dropped
back below the scheduling threshold, the job may remain suspended because
of another threshold. The job does not resume until all load indices are
within their scheduling thresholds.</P>

<H2><A NAME="15141"></A>Monitoring Resource Consumption of Jobs</H2>

<P><A NAME="15145"></A>Jobs submitted through the LSF Batch system have
the resources they consume monitored while they are running. The <TT>-l</TT>
option of the <TT>bjobs</TT> command displays the current resource usage
of the job. This job-level information includes: </P>

<UL>
<LI><A NAME="15146"></A>Total CPU time consumed by all processes in the
job </LI>

<LI><A NAME="15147"></A>Total resident memory usage in kbytes of all currently
running processes in a job </LI>

<LI><A NAME="15148"></A>Total virtual memory usage in kbytes of all currently
running processes in a job </LI>

<LI><A NAME="15149"></A>Currently active process group ID in a job </LI>

<LI><A NAME="15150"></A>Currently active processes in a job </LI>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="15151"></A>The job-level resource usage information is updated
at a maximum frequency of every <TT>SBD_SLEEP_TIME</TT> seconds (see <A HREF="11-lsbatch-reference.html#23026">'The
<TT>lsb.params</TT> File'</A> of the <I><A HREF="admin-title.html#998232">LSF
Administrator's Guide</A></I> for the value of <TT><A HREF="11-lsbatch-reference.html#4290">SBD_SLEEP_TIME</A></TT>).
The update is done only if the value for the CPU time, resident memory
usage, or virtual memory usage has changed by more than 10 percent from
the previous update or if a new process or process group has been created.</P>

<P><A NAME="699"></A>Sometimes you want to know what has happened to your
job since it was submitted. The <TT>bhist</TT> command displays a summary
of the pending, suspended and running time of batch jobs. The <TT>-l</TT>

<P><A NAME="11508"></A>The <TT>-J <I>job_name</I></TT> option of the <TT>bhist</TT>
command displays the history of all LSF Batch jobs with the specified job
name. Job names are assigned with the <TT>-J <I>job_name</I></TT> option
of the <TT>bsub</TT> command.</P>

<P><A NAME="13394"></A>LSF keeps job history information after the job
exits, so you can look at the history of jobs that completed in the past.
The length of the history depends on how often the LSF administrator cleans
up the log files.</P>

<P><A NAME="11554"></A>By default, <TT>bhist</TT> only displays job history
from the current event log file. The <TT>-n</TT> option to the <TT>bhist</TT>
command allows users to display the history of jobs that completed a long
time ago, and are no longer listed in the active event log.</P>

<P><A NAME="11509"></A>The LSF Batch system periodically backs up and prunes
the job history log. The <TT>-n </TT><I>num_logfiles</I> option tells the
<TT>bhist</TT> command to search through the specified number of log files
instead of only searching the current log file. Log files are searched
in reverse time order; for example, the command <TT>bhist -n 3</TT> searches
the current event log file and then the two most recent backup files.</P>

<H2><A NAME="3007"></A>Checking Partial Job Output</H2>

<P><A NAME="15063"></A>The output from an LSF Batch job is normally not
available until the job is finished. However, LSF Batch provides the <TT>bpeek</TT>
command for you to look at the output the job has produced so far. By default,
<TT>bpeek</TT> shows the output from the most recently submitted job; you
can also select the job by queue or execution host, or specify the job
ID or job name on the command line.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="15064"></A>% <B>bpeek 1234
</B>&lt;&lt; output from stdout &gt;&gt;
Starting phase 1
Phase 1 done
Calculating new parameters
...</PRE>

<P><A NAME="15065"></A>Only the job owner can use <TT>bpeek</TT> to see
job output. The <TT>bpeek</TT> command will not work on a job running under
a different user account.</P>

<P><A NAME="13500"></A>You can use this command to check if your job is
behaving as you expected and kill the job if it is running away or producing
unusable results. This could save you time.</P>

<H2><A NAME="3026"></A>Displaying Queue and Host Status</H2>

<P><A NAME="5151"></A>The <TT>bqueues</TT> and <TT>bhosts</TT> commands
display the number of jobs in a queue or dispatched to a host. For more
information on these commands see <A HREF="05-lsbatch.html#10796">'Batch
Queues'</A> and <A HREF="05-lsbatch.html#3189">'Batch Hosts'</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="5005"></A>Killing Jobs</H2>

<P><A NAME="5006"></A>The <TT>bkill</TT> command cancels pending batch
jobs and sends signals to running jobs. By default, <TT>bkill</TT> sends
the <TT>SIGKILL</TT> signal to running jobs. For example, to kill job 3421
enter:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="5007"></A>% <B>bkill 3421
</B>Job &lt;3421&gt; is being terminated</PRE>

<P><A NAME="5008"></A>20 seconds before <TT>SIGKILL</TT> is sent, <TT>SIGINT</TT>
and <TT>SIGTERM</TT> are sent to give the job a chance to catch the signals
and clean up. The signals are forwarded from the <TT>mbatchd</TT> to the
<TT>sbatchd</TT>. The <TT>sbatchd</TT> waits for the job to exit before
reporting the status. Because of this, <TT>bjobs</TT> may still report
that the job is running for a few seconds.</P>

<P><A NAME="5009"></A>To send an arbitrary signal to your job, use the
<TT>-s</TT> option of the <TT>bkill</TT> command. You can specify either
the signal name or the signal number. On most versions of UNIX, signal
names and numbers are listed in the <TT>kill(1)</TT> or <TT>signal(2)</TT>
manual page.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="5010"></A>% <B>bkill -s TSTP 3421
</B>Job &lt;3421&gt; is being signaled</PRE>

<P><A NAME="5011"></A>This example sends the TSTP signal to job 3421. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="11708"></A><B>Note<BR>
</B><I>Signal numbers are translated across different platforms because
different operating systems may have different signal numbering. The real
meaning of a specific signal is interpreted by the machine from which the
</I><TT>bkill</TT><I> command is issued. For example, if you send signal
18 from an SunOS 4.x host, it means </I><TT>SIGTSTP</TT><I>. If the job
is running on an HP-UX, </I><TT>SIGTSTP</TT><I> is defined as signal number
25, so signal 25 is sent to the job.</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="5012"></A>Only the owner of a batch job or an LSF administrator
can send signals to a job.</P>

<H2><A NAME="5013"></A>Suspending and Resuming Jobs</H2>

<P><A NAME="5014"></A>The <TT>bstop</TT> and <TT>bresume</TT> commands
are convenient aliases for <TT>bkill -s</TT>, sending the <TT>SIGSTOP</TT>/<TT>SIGTSTP</TT>
and <TT>SIGCONT</TT> signals respectively. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="11763"></A><B>Note<BR>
</B><I>You cannot send arbitrary signals to a pending job; most signals
are only valid for running jobs. However, LSF Batch does allow you to kill,
suspend and resume pending jobs.</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="5015"></A>To suspend job 3421, enter:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="5016"></A>% <B>bstop 3421
</B>Job &lt;3421&gt; is being stopped</PRE>

<P><A NAME="5017"></A><TT>bstop</TT> sends the <TT>SIGSTOP</TT> signal
to sequential jobs and <TT>SIGTSTP</TT> to parallel jobs. SIGTSTP is sent
to a parallel job so the master process can trap the signal and pass it
to all the slave processes running on other hosts.</P>

<P><A NAME="12375"></A>To resume the same job, enter:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="5018"></A>% <B>bresume 3421
</B>Job &lt;3421&gt; is being resumed</PRE>

<P><A NAME="5019"></A>Suspending a job causes your job to go into <TT><A HREF="05-lsbatch.html#3001">USUSP</A></TT>
state if the job is already started, or to go into <TT><A HREF="05-lsbatch.html#2999">PSUSP</A></TT>
state if your job is pending. Resuming a user suspended job does not put
your job into <TT><A HREF="05-lsbatch.html#2980">RUN</A></TT> state immediately.
If your job was running before the suspension, <TT>bresume</TT> first puts
your job into <TT><A HREF="05-lsbatch.html#3003">SSUSP</A></TT> state and
then waits for <TT>sbatchd</TT> to schedule it according to the load conditions.</P>

<H2><A NAME="5024"></A>Moving Jobs Within and Between Queues</H2>

<P><A NAME="5026"></A>The <TT>btop</TT> and <TT>bbot</TT> commands move
pending jobs within a queue. <TT>btop</TT> moves jobs toward the top of
the queue, so that they are dispatched before other pending jobs. <TT>bbot</TT>
moves jobs toward the bottom of the queue so that they are dispatched later.
The default behaviour is to move the job as close to the top or bottom
of the queue as possible. By specifying a position on the command line,
you can move a job to an arbitrary position relative to the top or bottom
of the queue.</P>

<P><A NAME="5027"></A>The <TT>btop</TT> and <TT>bbot</TT> commands do not
allow users to move their own jobs ahead of those submitted by other users;
only the dispatch order of the user's own jobs is changed. Only an LSF
administrator can move one user's job ahead of another. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="13707"></A><B>Note<BR>
</B><I>The </I><TT>btop</TT><I> and </I><TT>bbot</TT><I> commands have
no effect on the job dispatch order when fairshare policies are used. </I></P>

<H2><A NAME="14955"></A>Job Parameter Modification</H2>

<P><A NAME="12897"></A>The parameters associated with a job can be modified
after the job has been submitted. The <TT>bmodify command allows for changes
to the parameters of already submitted jobs. The parameters of a job can
be modified only if the job is in pending status. </TT></P>

<P><A NAME="12898"></A>The <TT>bmodify</TT> command takes the same options
as the <TT>bsub</TT> command together with a job ID. (See <A HREF="06-submitting.html#343">'Submitting
Batch Jobs'</A>.) The given options replace the existing options of the
specified job.</P>

<P><A NAME="13151"></A>To reset an option to its default value, append
the <TT>n</TT> character to the option name. No option value should be
specified when resetting an option. For example:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="13174"></A>% <B>bmodify -bn 123</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="13191"></A>Job 123 will be dispatched as soon as possible,
ignoring any previously specified start time. The following example shows
how <TT>bmodify</TT> is used to change the start time to 2 A.M.:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="13812"></A><TT>% <B>bmodify -b 2:00</B></TT></PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="12776"></A><B>Note<BR>
</B><I>The job command line itself and the environment variables present
at submission time cannot be modified. In versions of LSF prior to V3.0,
the shell option set with the </I><TT>-L</TT><I> argument also could not
be modified.</I></P>

<H2><A NAME="16058"></A>Job Tracking and Manipulation Using <TT>xlsbatch</TT></H2>

<P><A NAME="16260"></A>Most of the operations discussed in this chapter
can also be performed using the <TT>xlsbatch</TT> GUI. The main window
of <TT>xlsbatch</TT> is shown in <A HREF="02-get-started.html#13749">'Figure
4. <TT>xlsbatch</TT> Main Window'</A>. </P>

<P><A NAME="16264"></A>You can view job details by first select a job and
then click on the '<TT>Detail</TT>' button. The resulting popup window
is shown in <A HREF="07-tracking.html#16289">Figure 11</A>. This gives
you the same information as you can get by running the <TT>bjobs -l</TT>
command. </P>

</P>

<P><A NAME="16208"></A>The '<TT>History</TT>' button gives you a popup
window for job history as you can otherwise get through the <TT>bhist</TT>
command. </P>

<P><A NAME="16213"></A>To perform control actions on jobs, such as killing
a job or suspending/resuming a job, simply select the job and then click
on an action button.</P>

<P><A NAME="16229"></A>You can also invoke the <TT>xbsub</TT> window from
inside xlsbatch to submit new jobs. If you want to modify a job parameter,
simply select on the job and click on '<TT>Modify</TT>' button to get the
job modification popup window. Note that this window can also be invoked
by running <TT>xbmodify</TT> from the command line. <A HREF="07-tracking.html#16307">Figure
12</A> shows the <TT>xbmodify</TT> window. This window is the similar to
the <TT>xbsub</TT> window except that the command line is read-only.</P>
