<H1><A NAME="355"></A>Chapter 12. <A NAME="343"></A>Customizing Batch Jobs
for LSF</H1>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P><A NAME="2621"></A>This chapter describes how to customize your batch
jobs to take advantage of LSF and LSF Batch features.</P>

<H2><A NAME="3037"></A>Environment Variables</H2>

<P><A NAME="2897"></A>When LSF Batch runs a batch job it sets several environment
variables. Batch jobs can use the values of these variables to control
how they execute. The environment variables set by LSF Batch are:</P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="4952"></A><TT>LSB_JOBID </TT></DT>

<DD>The LSF Batch job ID number. </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="5038"></A><TT>LSB_JOBFILENAME </TT></DT>

<DD>The full path name of the batch job file. This is a <TT>/bin/sh</TT>
script on UNIX systems or a <TT>.BAT</TT> command script on Windows NT
systems that invokes the batch job. </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="5088"></A><TT>LSB_HOSTS </TT></DT>

<DD>The list of hosts selected by LSF Batch to run the batch job. If the
job is run on a single processor, the value of <TT>LSB_HOSTS</TT> is the
name of the execution host. For parallel jobs, the names of all execution
hosts are listed separated by spaces. The batch job file is run on the
first host in the list. </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="5142"></A><TT>LSB_QUEUE </TT></DT>

<DD>The name of the batch queue from which the job was dispatched. </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="5153"></A><TT>LSB_JOBNAME </TT></DT>

<DD>The name of the batch job as specified by the <TT>-J <I>job_name</I></TT>
argument to <TT>bsub</TT>. If this argument was not given, the job name
is the actual batch command as specified on the <TT>bsub</TT> command line.
</DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="5172"></A><TT>LSB_RESTART </TT></DT>

<DD>If this batch job was submitted with the <TT>-r</TT> option to <TT>bsub</TT>,
has run previously, and has been restarted because of a host failure, <TT>LSB_RESTART</TT>
is set to the value <TT>Y</TT>. If this is not a restarted job <TT>LSB_RESTART</TT>
is not set. </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="9212"></A><TT>LSB_EXIT_PRE_ABORT </TT></DT>

<DD>The value of this parameter can be used by a queue or job-level pre-execution
command so that the command can exit with this value, if it wants the job
be aborted instead of being requeued or executed. </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="9316"></A><TT>LSB_EXIT_REQUEUE </TT></DT>

<DD>This variable is a list of exit values defined in the queue's <TT>REQUEUE_EXIT_VALUE</TT>
parameter. If this variable is defined, a job will be requeued if it exits
with one of these values. This variable is not set if the queue does not
have <TT>REQUEUE_EXIT_VALUE</TT> defined. </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="12035"></A><TT>LSB_JOB_STARTER </TT></DT>

<DD>This variable is defined if a Job Starter command is defined for the
queue. See <A HREF="08-interactive.html#12109">'Job Starter'</A>. </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="12040"></A><TT>LSB_INTERACTIVE </TT></DT>

<DD>This variable is set to '<TT>Y</TT>' if the job is an interactive job.
An interactive job is submitted using the <TT>-I</TT> option to <TT>bsub</TT>.
This variable is not defined if the job is not interactive. See <A HREF="08-interactive.html#11905">'Interactive
Batch Job Support'</A>. </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="9202"></A><TT>LS_JOBPID </TT></DT>

<DD>The process ID of the job. This is always a shell script process that
runs the actual job. </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="12284"></A><TT>LS_SUBCWD </TT></DT>

<DD>This is the directory on the submission host where the job was submitted.
By default LSF Batch assumes a uniform user name and user ID space exists
among all the hosts in the cluster, that is, a job submitted by a given
user will run under the same user's account on the execution host. For
situations where non-uniform user id/user name space exists, account mapping
must be used to determine the account used to run a job. See <A HREF="05-lsbatch.html#12346">'User
Controlled Account Mapping'</A>. </DD>
</DL>

<H2><A NAME="3050"></A>Parallel Jobs</H2>

<P><A NAME="2944"></A>Each parallel programming package has different requirements
for specifying and communicating with all the hosts used by a parallel
job. LSF is not tailored to work with a specific parallel programming package.
Instead, LSF provides a generic interface so that any parallel package
can be supported by writing shell scripts or wrapper programs. Example
shell scripts are provided for running PVM, P4, MPI, and POE programs as
parallel batch jobs.</P>

<H3><A NAME="5354"></A>Getting the Host List</H3>

<P><A NAME="5514"></A>The hosts allocated for the parallel job are passed
to the batch job in the <TT>LSB_HOSTS</TT> environment variable. Some applications
can take this list of hosts directly as a command line parameter. For other
applications you may need to process the host list. The following example
shows a <TT>/bin/sh</TT> script that processes all the hosts in the host
list, including identifying the host where the job script is executing.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="7387"></A>#!/bin/sh
# Process the list of host names in LSB_HOSTS

for host in $LSB_HOSTS ; do
handle_host $host
done</PRE>

<P><A NAME="12351"></A>LSF comes with a few scripts for running parallel
jobs under LSF Batch, such as <TT>pvmjob</TT>, <TT>poejob</TT>, <TT>mpijob</TT>,
<TT>p4job</TT>, etc. These scripts are installed In the <TT>LSF_BINDIR</TT>
as defined in <TT>lsf.conf</TT> file. You can modify these scripts to support
more parallel packages.</P>

<H3><A NAME="5323"></A>Starting Parallel Tasks With <TT>lstools</TT></H3>

<P><A NAME="5804"></A>For simple parallel jobs you can use the <TT>lstools</TT>
commands to start parts of the job on other hosts. Because the <TT>lstools</TT>
commands handle signals transparently, LSF Batch can suspend and resume
all components of your job without additional programming.</P>

<P><A NAME="5863"></A>The simplest parallel job runs an identical copy
of the executable on every host. The <TT>lsgrun</TT> command takes a list
of host names and runs the specified task on each host. The <TT>lsgrun
-p</TT> option specifies that the task should be run in parallel on each
host. The example below submits a job that uses <TT>lsgrun</TT> to run
<TT>myjob</TT> on all the selected batch hosts in parallel:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="7626"></A>% <B>bsub -n 10 'lsgrun -p -m &quot;$LSB_HOSTS&quot; myjob'
</B>Job &lt;3856&gt; is submitted to default queue &lt;normal&gt;.</PRE>

<P><A NAME="6135"></A>For more complicated jobs, you can write a shell
script that runs <TT>lsrun</TT> in the background to start each component.</P>

<H3><A NAME="6090"></A>Using <TT>lsmake</TT> to Run Parallel Batch Jobs</H3>

<P><A NAME="6167"></A>For parallel jobs that have a variety of different
components to run, you can use <TT>lsmake</TT>. Create a makefile that
lists all the components of your batch job and then submit the <TT>lsmake</TT>
command to LSF Batch. The following example shows a <TT>bsub</TT> command
and Makefile for a simple parallel job.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="7674"></A>% <B>bsub -n 4 lsmake -f Parjob.makefile
</B>Job &lt;3858&gt; is submitted to default queue &lt;normal&gt;.</PRE>

<PRE><A NAME="11206"></A>% <B>cat Parjob.makefile
</B># Makefile to run example parallel job using lsbatch and lsmake

all:    part1 part2 part3 part4

part1 part2 part3:
        myjob data.$@

part4:
        myjob2 data.part1 data.part2 data.part3</PRE>

<P><A NAME="12318"></A>The batch job has four components. The first three
components run the <TT>myjob</TT> command on the data.part1, data.part2
and data.part3 files. The fourth component runs the <TT>myjob2</TT> command
on all three data files. There are no dependencies between the components,
so <TT>lsmake</TT> runs them in parallel.</P>

<H3><A NAME="12322"></A>Submitting PVM Jobs to LSF Batch</H3>

<P><A NAME="12328"></A>PVM is a parallel programming system distributed
by Oak Ridge National Laboratories. PVM programs are controlled by a file,
the <I>PVM hosts file</I>, that contains host names and other information.
The <TT>pvmjob</TT> shell script supplied with LSF can be used to run PVM
programs as parallel LSF Batch jobs. The <TT>pvmjob</TT> script reads the
LSF Batch environment variables, sets up the PVM hosts file and then runs
the PVM job. If your PVM job needs special options in the hosts file, you
can modify the <TT>pvmjob</TT> script.</P>

<P><A NAME="6307"></A>For example, if the command line to run your PVM
job is</P>

<PRE><A NAME="6309"></A>% <B>myjob data1 -o out1</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="6308"></A>the following command submits this job to LSF Batch
to run on 10 hosts:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="6314"></A>% <B>bsub -n 10 pvmjob myjob data1 -o out1</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="6939"></A>Other parallel programming packages can be supported
in the same way. The <TT>p4job</TT> shell script runs jobs that use the
P4 parallel programming library. Other packages can be handled by creating
similar scripts.</P>

<H3><A NAME="9567"></A>Submitting MPI Jobs to LSF Batch</H3>

<P><A NAME="9570"></A>The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a portable
library that supports parallel programming. LSF supports MPICH, a joint
implementation of MPI by Argonne National Laboratory and Mississippi State
University. This version supports both TCP/IP and IBM's Message Passing
Library (MPL) communication protocols.</P>

<P><A NAME="9577"></A>LSF provides an <TT>mpijob</TT> shell script that
you can use to submit MPI jobs to LSF Batch. The <TT>mpijob</TT> script
writes the hosts allocated to the job by the LSF Batch system to a file
and supplies the file as an option to MPICH's mpirun command. The syntax
of the <TT>mpijob</TT> command is</P>

<PRE><A NAME="9578"></A>mpijob <I>option</I> mpirun <I>program </I>[<I>arguments</I>]</PRE>

<P><A NAME="9579"></A>where option is one of the following:</P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="9580"></A><TT>-tcp </TT></DT>

<DD>Write the LSF Batch hosts to a <TT>PROCGROUP</TT> file, supply the
<TT>-p4pg <I>procgroup_file</I></TT> option to the <TT>mpirun</TT> command,
and use the TCP/IP protocol. This is the default. </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="9581"></A><TT>-mpl </TT></DT>

<DD>Write the LSF Batch hosts to a <TT>MACHINE</TT> file, supply the <TT>-machinefile
<I>machine_file</I></TT> option to the <TT>mpirun</TT> command, and use
the MPL on an SP-2 system. </DD>
</DL>

<P><A NAME="9582"></A>The following examples show how to use <TT>mpijob</TT>
to submit MPI jobs to LSF Batch.</P>

<P><A NAME="9583"></A>To submit a job requesting four hosts and using the
default TCP/IP protocol, use</P>

<PRE><A NAME="9585"></A>% <B>bsub -n 4 mpijob mpirun myjob</B></PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="9593"></A><B>Note<BR>
</B><I>Before you can submit a job to a particular pool of IBM SP-2 nodes,
an LSF administrator must install the SP-2 ELIM. The SP-2 ELIM provides
the pool number and lock status of each node.</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="9594"></A>To submit the same job to run on four nodes in pool
1 on an IBM SP-2 system using MPL, use</P>

<PRE><A NAME="9596"></A>% <B>bsub -n 4 -R &quot;pool == 1&quot; mpijob -mpl mpirun myjob</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="10715"></A>To submit the same job to run on four nodes in pool
1 that are not locked (dedicated to using the High Performance Switch)
on an SP-2 system using MPL, use</P>

<PRE><A NAME="10716"></A>% <B>bsub -n 4 -q mpiq -R &quot;pool == 1 &amp;&amp; lock == 0&quot; mpijob -mpl mpirun myjob</B></PRE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="9604"></A><B>Note<BR>
</B><I>Before you can submit a job using the IBM SP-2 High Performance
Switch in dedicated mode, an LSF administrator must set up a queue for
automatic requeue on job failure. The job queue will automatically requeue
a job that failed because an SP-2 node was locked after LSF Batch selected
the node but before the job was dispatched.</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><A NAME="8483"></A>Submitting POE Jobs to LSF Batch</H3>

<P><A NAME="8486"></A>The Parallel Operating Environment (POE) is an execution
environment provided by IBM on SP-2 systems to hide the differences between
serial and parallel execution.</P>

<P><A NAME="8490"></A>LSF provides a <TT>poejob</TT> shell script that
you can use to submit POE jobs to LSF Batch. The <TT>poejob</TT> script
translates the hosts allocated to the job by the LSF Batch system into
an appropriate POE host list and sets up environment variables necessary
to run the job.</P>

<P><A NAME="8672"></A>The <TT>poejob</TT> script does not set the <TT>MP_EUILIB</TT>
and <TT>MP_EUIDEVICE</TT> environment variables, so you have to do this.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="8501"></A>% <B>setenv MP_EUILIB us</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="8567"></A>By default, <TT>MP_EUIDEVICE</TT> is <TT>css0</TT>.
Or,</P>

<PRE><A NAME="8503"></A>% <B>setenv MP_EUILIB ip
</B>% <B>setenv MP_EUIDEVICE en0</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="8682"></A>The following are examples of how to submit POE jobs.</P>

<P><A NAME="8506"></A>To submit a job requesting four SP-2 nodes configured
for the poeq queue, use</P>

<PRE><A NAME="8507"></A>% <B>bsub -n 4 -q poeq poejob myjob</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="8686"></A>By using LSF resource requirements, you can select
appropriate nodes for your job.</P>

<P><A NAME="8509"></A>To submit the same job requesting four SP-2 nodes
from pool 2 configured for the poeq queue, use</P>

<PRE><A NAME="8510"></A>% <B>bsub -n 4 -R &quot;pool == 2&quot; -q poeq poejob myjob</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="8512"></A>To submit the same job requesting four SP-2 nodes
from pool 2 with at least 20 megabytes of swap space, use</P>

<PRE><A NAME="8514"></A>% <B>bsub -n 4 -R &quot;(pool == 2) &amp;&amp; (swap &gt; 20)&quot; -q poeq poejob myjob</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="8515"></A>To submit the same job requesting four SP-2 nodes
from pool 2 that are not locked (dedicated to using the High Performance
Switch), use</P>

<PRE><A NAME="8692"></A>% <B>bsub -n 4 -R &quot;(pool == 2) &amp;&amp; (lock == 0)&quot; -q poeq poejob myjob</B></PRE>

<H2><A NAME="12419"></A>Using a Job Starter for Parallel Jobs</H2>

<P><A NAME="12420"></A>The above examples use a script to run parallel
jobs under LSF Batch. Alternatively, your LSF administrator could configure
the script into your queue as a job starter. With a job starter configured
at the queue, you can submit the above parallel jobs without having to
type the script name. See <A HREF="07-manage-lsbatch.html#15643">'Using
A Job Starter'</A> in the <I><A HREF="admin-title.html">LSF Administrator's
Guide</A></I> for more information about a job starter. </P>

<P><A NAME="12364"></A>To see if your queue already has a job starter defined,
run the <TT>bqueues -l</TT> command.</P>
