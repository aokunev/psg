<H1><A NAME="998239"></A>Chapter 1. <A NAME="997895"></A>Introduction</H1>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P><A NAME="998330"></A>The first two chapters of this guide give a quick
introduction to production job scheduling and LSF JobScheduler. You should
be able to begin using JobScheduler after reading these chapters. The rest
of the guide contains more detailed information on JobScheduler features
and commands.</P>

<H2><A NAME="998896"></A>What is JobScheduler?</H2>

<P><A NAME="998872"></A>Production job scheduling has been an integral
part of mainframe data processing operation for decades. With the emergence
of distributed computing along with Unix and Windows NT workstations and
fileservers, the system architecture has changed drastically, calling for
a new approach to production job scheduling.</P>

<P><A NAME="999214"></A>LSF JobScheduler is a distributed production job
scheduling product from Platform Computing Corporation. It is a separately
licensed component of the Load Sharing Facility (LSF) Suite, a general
purpose distributed computing system that unites a network of computers
into a single system.</P>

<P><A NAME="1000973"></A>JobScheduler integrates heterogeneous servers
into a 'virtual mainframe' to deliver high availability, robustness and
ease-of-use. It provides the functions of traditional mainframe job scheduling
with transparent operation across a network of heterogeneous UNIX and NT
systems. JobScheduler offers GUI input tools in addition to the standard
command line interface.</P>

<H3><A NAME="1000977"></A>Calendar and Event-driven Scheduling</H3>

<P><A NAME="998939"></A>In production data processing environments, jobs
often need to be processed repetitively and periodically according to user-defined
calendars. Job processing may also be conditional upon certain events occurring
such as the arrival of a specific file or the availability of a data set.</P>

<P><A NAME="998921"></A>Calendars can be defined in JobScheduler to drive
time dependent job processing. Flexible time expressions can be used to
define time events that constitute a calendar. Calendars are defined independent
of jobs; jobs can be associated with calendars.</P>

<P><A NAME="998990"></A>Job scheduling in JobScheduler can also be driven
by arbitrarily configured network-wide events. This can be used, for example,
to detect a change in the size of a file or the mount of a tape to trigger
production jobs.</P>

<H3><A NAME="1000705"></A>Fault Tolerance</H3>

<P><A NAME="1000514"></A>JobScheduler is designed to continue operating
even if some of the servers in the system are unavailable. A dynamic master
succession algorithm ensures that as long as one server is up the jobs
will continue to be scheduled on the remaining hosts. Even if the entire
network goes down, no jobs will be lost because all calendars, job records
and events are logged in a configured file system. When the system comes
back up, it will recover the state of the JobScheduler and continue operation.</P>

<H3><A NAME="999288"></A>Inter-job Dependency</H3>

<P><A NAME="999292"></A>JobScheduler allows you to control a job's execution
upon the completion, failure, or start of other jobs. For example, you
can configure the system to start several main processing jobs only after
a data preparation job has completed, then you can start the post-processing
job after all the main processing jobs are done. These jobs do not have
to run on the same host. </P>

<H3><A NAME="999485"></A>Pre-execution and Post-execution</H3>

<P><A NAME="1001134"></A>JobScheduler can also be configured to run a pre-execution
command before job execution and a post-execution command after job execution.
This is useful if some preparation work (for example, mounting a device)
has to be performed successfully before starting the job and/or when cleaning
up is needed after the job finishes.</P>

<H3><A NAME="1001135"></A>Job History</H3>

<P><A NAME="1001141"></A>JobScheduler maintains full history data of all
jobs. The history information tells you what has happened to your job since
it was submitted.</P>

<H3><A NAME="1001140"></A>Command Set and GUI Tools</H3>

<P><A NAME="1000764"></A>JobScheduler provides a rich set of command line
and GUI tools to define, monitor and manage the workload using any desktop
as the system console. Typically you define your calendars and jobs together
with any interdependency using the GUI tools<I> </I><TT>xbcal</TT> and
<TT>xbsub</TT>. Once these are set up, JobScheduler will ensure that jobs
are run according to the conditions and policies specified.</P>

<P><A NAME="1000774"></A>You can keep close track of your jobs with JobScheduler
using the GUI program <TT>xlsbatch</TT>. As well as monitoring the status
of jobs, the system allows you to perform various operations on them, including:</P>

<UL>
<LI><A NAME="1000769"></A>Terminating, suspending, and resuming each run
of a job, as well as removing the entire job from the system. </LI>

<LI><A NAME="1000742"></A>Inspecting the output of a running job. </LI>

<LI><A NAME="1000743"></A>Looking at the history of a repetitive job for
all its run instances. </LI>

<LI><A NAME="1000744"></A>Changing any parameter of a job, including switching
it from one queue to another even while it is running. </LI>

<LI><A NAME="1000745"></A>Inquiring why a job has not been scheduled. </LI>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="1000415"></A>Automatic Load Balancing</H3>

<P><A NAME="999325"></A>With JobScheduler, you can target jobs to specific
servers or you can allow the system to match resource requirements of your
jobs to the capabilities of the servers. JobScheduler dynamically collects
system load information about all aspects of computing resource including
CPU, memory, I/O, disk space, interactive activities, etc. Jobs are dynamically
scheduled to run on the best server available. For example, you can submit
a job indicating it requires 100 megabytes of temporary storage space before
it starts. JobScheduler will ensure that the server the job is run on satisfies
the condition.</P>

<H3><A NAME="1001166"></A>Network-wide Load and Resource Monitoring</H3>

<P><A NAME="1001167"></A>JobScheduler comes with a comprehensive set of
tools for monitoring your cluster. These tools allow you to view your cluster
of resources from any node of the cluster so that you know the dynamic
resource usage of all your machines.</P>

<H2><A NAME="1001165"></A>Structure of JobScheduler</H2>

<H4><A NAME="1000874"></A>Figure 1. The Structure of LSF JobScheduler </H4>

</P>

<H3><A NAME="1000806"></A>Clusters</H3>

<P><A NAME="1000811"></A>Production job scheduling and load sharing in
JobScheduler is based on <I>clusters</I>. A cluster is a named group of
machines configured to share resources transparently. It consists of one
or more server hosts and zero or more client-only hosts. A server host
is a machine that runs JobScheduler daemons and executes user jobs. A client-only
host does not run JobScheduler daemons and does not execute user submitted
jobs, but users on a client-only host can still use the JobScheduler user
interface such as commands and GUIs.</P>

<P><A NAME="1001190"></A>One of the server hosts is configured as the master
for the cluster. It runs the master scheduler daemon, <TT>mbatchd</TT>.
All server hosts run the slave execution server, <TT>sbatchd</TT>, which
manages jobs dispatched by the master scheduler. Each server host also
runs a Load Information Manager daemon, <TT>lim</TT>. It monitors the availability
of resources and makes this information available to JobScheduler and other
LSF utilities.</P>

<P><A NAME="1000819"></A>Each cluster has one or more cluster administrators.
A cluster administrator is a user account that has permission to change
the JobScheduler configuration and perform other maintenance functions.
The cluster administrator decides how the JobScheduler cluster is configured.</P>

<P><A NAME="1001048"></A>The master scheduler maintains the status of all
entities defined in the system including jobs, events, calendars, and queues.</P>

<H3><A NAME="1000419"></A>Jobs</H3>

<P><A NAME="1000434"></A>A <I>job</I> is a program or command that is scheduled
to run in a specific environment. A job has many attributes specifying
the scheduling and execution requirements. Job attributes are specified
by the user who submits the job. JobScheduler uses job attributes, system
resource information and configured scheduling policies to decide when,
where, and how to run the job. Each job is assigned a unique job identification
number by the system. You can associate your own job names to make referencing
easier.</P>

<H3><A NAME="1000615"></A>Events</H3>

<P><A NAME="1000634"></A>An <I>event</I> is a change or occurrence in the
system such as the arrival (creation) of a specific file, a tape becoming
on-line, a prior job completing successfully, or a particular time, that
can be used to trigger jobs. JobScheduler responds to four types of events:</P>

<UL>
<LI><A NAME="1000622"></A>Time events are points of time that can be used
to trigger the scheduling of jobs. Time events are defined by calendars.
</LI>

<LI><A NAME="1000623"></A>Job events are the starting and completion of
other jobs. </LI>

<LI><A NAME="1000624"></A>File events are changes in the file status. </LI>

<LI><A NAME="1000628"></A>Site events are site specific occurrences, such
as a tape mount, defined by the JobScheduler administrators for your cluster.
</LI>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="1001060"></A>When defining a job, it is possible to specify
any combination of events that must be satisfied before the job is considered
eligible for execution.</P>

<H3><A NAME="1000425"></A>Calendars</H3>

<P><A NAME="1000427"></A>A <I>calendar</I> consists of a sequence of time
events, during which a job can be scheduled. Calendars are defined and
manipulated independently of jobs so that multiple jobs can share the same
calendar. Each user can maintain a private set of calendars, reference
calendars of other users, or use the calendars configured into the system.
A calendar can be modified after it has been created. Any new jobs associated
with it will automatically run according to the new definition.</P>

<H3><A NAME="1001018"></A>Queues</H3>

<P><A NAME="1001019"></A>Production job scheduling provides efficient,
timely execution of mission-critical jobs. When you submit a job, it is
placed into a <I>queue</I>. The JobScheduler system runs jobs from the
queue based on the scheduled time and when the appropriate resources are
available. Jobs from a queue can be dispatched to any server hosts in your
cluster that are configured to run jobs for the queue.</P>

<P><A NAME="1001244"></A>A queue can be configured with many features that
make your life easier. JobScheduler allows you to define various types
of services by configuring different queues. For each queue, you can configure
a rich set of parameters that customize job scheduling policies, job execution
behavior, and resource allocation constraints.</P>
