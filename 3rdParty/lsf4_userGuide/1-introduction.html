<H1><A NAME="48260"></A>Chapter 1. <A NAME="1339"></A>Introduction</H1>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P><A NAME="47792"></A>This chapter gives an overview of the LSF system
architecture and the load sharing services provided by the LSF API, introducing
their components. It also demonstrates how to write, compile, and link
a simple load sharing application using LSF.</P>

<H2><A NAME="47809"></A>LSF Product Suite and Architecture</H2>

<P><A NAME="47642"></A>The Load Sharing Facility (LSF) is a layer of software
services on top of UNIX and Windows NT operating systems. LSF creates a
single system image on a network of heterogeneous computers such that the
whole network of computing resources can be utilized effectively and managed
easily. Throughout this guide, LSF refers to the LSF suite of products,
which contains the following components: </P>

<H4><A NAME="47872"></A>LSF Base </H4>

<UL>
<P><A NAME="47876"></A>LSF Base provides the basic load-sharing services
across a heterogeneous network of computers. It is the base software upon
which all other LSF functional components are built. It provides services
such as resource information, host selection, placement advice, transparent
remote execution and remote file operation, etc.</P>

<P><A NAME="47888"></A>LSF Base includes Load Information Manager (LIM),
Remote Execution Server (RES), the LSF Base API, <TT>lstools</TT> that
allow the use of the LSF Base to run simple load-sharing applications,
<TT>lstcsh</TT>, and <TT>lsmake</TT>.</P>
</UL>

<H4><A NAME="47899"></A>LSF Batch </H4>

<UL>
<P><A NAME="47906"></A>LSF Batch is a distributed batch queuing system
built on top of the LSF Base. The services provided by LSF Batch are extensions
to the LSF Base services. LSF Batch makes a computer network a network
batch computer. It has all the features of a mainframe batch job processing
system while doing load balancing and policy-driven resource allocation
control. </P>

<P><A NAME="47922"></A>LSF Batch relies on services provided by the LSF
Base. It makes use of the resource and load information from the LIM to
do load balancing. LSF Batch also uses the cluster configuration information
from LIM and follows the master election service provided by LIM. LSF Batch
uses RES for interactive batch job execution and uses the remote file operation
service provided by RES for file transfer. LSF Batch includes a Master
Batch Daemon (<TT>mbatchd</TT>) running on the master host and a slave
Batch Daemon (<TT>sbatchd</TT>) running on each batch server host.</P>
</UL>

<H4><A NAME="47936"></A>LSF JobScheduler </H4>

<UL>
<P><A NAME="47940"></A>LSF JobScheduler is a network production job scheduling
system that automates the mission-critical activities of a MIS organization.
It provides reliable job scheduling on a heterogeneous network of computers
with centralized control. LSF JobScheduler reacts to calendars and events
to schedule jobs at the correct time on the correct machines. </P>

<P><A NAME="47956"></A>Like LSF Batch, LSF JobScheduler is built on top
of the LSF Base. It relies on LSF Base in resource matching, job placement,
cluster configuration, and distributed file operation. LSF JobScheduler
support calendars, file events, and user defined events in scheduling production
jobs. </P>
</UL>

<H4><A NAME="47964"></A>LSF MultiCluster </H4>

<UL>
<P><A NAME="47971"></A>LSF MultiCluster extends the capabilities of the
LSF system by sharing the resources of an organization across multiple
cooperating clusters of computers. Load sharing happens not only within
the clusters but also among them. Resource ownership and autonomy is enforced,
non-shared user accounts and file systems are supported, and communication
limitations among the clusters are also considered in job scheduling.</P>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="38873"></A>LSF consists of a number of servers running as root
on each participating host in an LSF cluster and a comprehensive set of
utilities built on top of the LSF Application Programming Interface (API).
The LSF API consists of two libraries:</P>

<UL>
<LI><A NAME="47828"></A>Basic LSF services are accessible to applications
through LSLIB, the LSF Base library </LI>

<LI><A NAME="47830"></A>Job scheduling and processing services are accessible
through LSF Batch library, LSBLIB. This library allows applications to
get services from LSF Batch and LSF JobScheduler. </LI>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="48418"></A>LSF Base </H3>

<P><A NAME="48437"></A><A HREF="1-introduction.html#48436">Figure 1</A>
shows the components of the LSF Base and their relationship. </P>

<H4><A NAME="48436"></A>Figure 1. LSF Base Architecture</H4>

<P><A HREF="prog-figure1.gif"><IMG SRC="prog-figure1.gif" ALT="LSF Base Architecture" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=170 WIDTH=626 ALIGN=ABSBOTTOM></A></P>

<P><A NAME="48444"></A>The LSF Base consists of two servers, the Load Information
Manager (LIM<I>) </I>and the Remote Execution Server (RES), and the Load
Sharing Library (LSLIB). The LSF Base provides the basic load sharing services
across a heterogeneous network of computers.</P>

<P><A NAME="41002"></A>An LSF server host is a host that runs load-shared
jobs. The LIM and RES run on every LSF server host. They interface directly
with the underlying operating systems and provide users with a uniform,
host independent environment.</P>

<P><A NAME="44494"></A>One of the LIMs acts as the master. The master LIM
is chosen among all the LIMs running in the cluster. If the master LIM
becomes unavailable, a LIM on another host will automatically take over.
</P>

<P><A NAME="44495"></A>The LIM on each host monitors its host's load and
reports load information to the master LIM. The master LIM collects information
from all hosts and provides that information to the applications. </P>

<P><A NAME="42647"></A>The RES on each server host accepts remote execution
requests and provides fast, transparent and secure remote execution of
tasks. </P>

<H3><A NAME="42648"></A>Application and LSF Base Interactions</H3>

<P><A NAME="42653"></A><A HREF="1-introduction.html#48081">Figure 2</A>
shows the typical interactions between an LSF application and the LSF Base.
</P>

<P><A NAME="21385"></A>In order to find out the information about the LSF
clusters, an application calls the information service functions in the
LSLIB which then contact the LIM to get the information. If the information
requested is only available from the master LIM, then LSLIB will automatically
send the request to the master host.</P>

<P><A NAME="21425"></A>To run a task remotely, or to perform a file operation
remotely, an application calls the remote execution or remote file operation
service functions in the LSLIB, which then contact the RES to get the services.</P>

<P><A NAME="21427"></A>The LIM on individual machines communicate periodically
to update the information they provide to the applications.</P>

<H4><A NAME="48081"></A>Figure 2. LIM, RES, LSLIB, and Applications</H4>

<P><A HREF="prog-figure2.gif"><IMG SRC="prog-figure2.gif" ALT="LIM, RES, LSLIB, and Applications" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=333 WIDTH=419></A></P>

<H3><A NAME="20923"></A>LSF Batch System</H3>

<P><A NAME="1668"></A>LSF Batch is a layered distributed load sharing batch
system built on top of the LSF Base. The services provided by LSF Batch
are extensions to the LSF Base services. Application programmers can access
the batch services through the LSF Batch Library, LSBLIB. The structure
of the LSF Batch system is shown in <A HREF="1-introduction.html#47656">Figure
3</A>. </P>

<H4><A NAME="47656"></A>Figure 3. Structure of LSF Batch System</H4>

<P><A HREF="prog-figure3.gif"><IMG SRC="prog-figure3.gif" ALT="Structure of LSF Batch System" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=170 WIDTH=416></A></P>

<P><A NAME="1140"></A>LSF Batch accepts user jobs and holds them in queues
until suitable hosts are available. LSF Batch runs user jobs on LSF Batch
server hosts, those hosts that a site deems suitable for running batch
jobs.</P>

<P><A NAME="48099"></A>LSF Batch services are provided by one <TT>mbatchd</TT>
(master batch daemon<I>)</I> running in each LSF cluster, and one <TT>sbatchd</TT>
(slave batch daemon) running on each batch server host. </P>

<P><A NAME="1211"></A>LSF Batch operation relies on the services provided
by the LSF Base. LSF Batch contacts the master LIM to get load and resource
information about every batch server host. The operation of LSF Batch is
shown in <A HREF="1-introduction.html#48186">Figure 4</A>. </P>

<H4><A NAME="48186"></A>Figure 4. The Operation of LSF Batch System</H4>

<P><A HREF="prog-figure4.gif"><IMG SRC="prog-figure4.gif" ALT="The Operation of LSF Batch System" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=308 WIDTH=383></A></P>

<P><A NAME="48456"></A><TT>mbatchd</TT> always runs on the host where master
LIM runs. The <TT>sbatchd</TT> on the master host automatically starts
the <TT>mbatchd</TT>. If the master LIM moves to a different host, the
current <TT>mbatchd</TT> will automatically resign and a new <TT>mbatchd</TT>
will be automatically started on the new master host.</P>

<P><A NAME="1730"></A>User jobs are held in batch queues by <TT>mbatchd</TT>,
which checks the load information on all candidate hosts periodically.
When a host with the necessary resources becomes available, <TT>mbatchd</TT>
sends a job to the <TT>sbatchd</TT> on that host for execution. When more
than one host is available, the best host is chosen. </P>

<P><A NAME="1593"></A>Once a job is sent to an <TT>sbatchd</TT>, that <TT>sbatchd</TT>
controls the execution of the job and reports job status to <TT>mbatchd</TT>.</P>

<P><A NAME="1682"></A>The log files store important system and job information
so that a newly started <TT>mbatchd</TT> can restore the status of the
previous <TT>mbatchd</TT> easily. The log files also provide historic information
about jobs, queues, hosts, and LSF Batch servers.</P>

<H3><A NAME="48208"></A>LSF JobScheduler System</H3>

<P><A NAME="48209"></A>LSF JobScheduler shares the same architecture and
job processing mechanism. In addition to services provided by LSF Batch,
LSF JobScheduler also provides calendar and event processing services.
Both LSF Batch and LSF JobScheduler provides API to applications via LSBLIB.
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="48212"></A><B>Note<BR>
</B><I>In the reminder of this Guide, all descriptions about LSF Batch
also apply to LSF JobScheduler unless explicitly stated otherwise. </I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><A NAME="2408"></A>LSF API Services</H2>

<P><A NAME="1729"></A>LSF services are natural extensions to operating
system services. LSF services glue heterogeneous operating systems into
a single, integrated computing system.</P>

<P><A NAME="38923"></A>LSF APIs provide easy access to the services of
LSF servers. The API routines hide the details of interactions between
the application and LSF servers in a way that is platform independent.
</P>

<P><A NAME="39068"></A>LSF APIs have been used to build numerous load sharing
applications and utilities. Some examples of applications built on top
of the LSF APIs are <TT>lsmake</TT>, <TT>lstcsh</TT>, <TT>lsrun</TT>, LSF
Batch user interface, and <TT>xlsmon</TT>.</P>

<H3><A NAME="44692"></A>LSF Base API Services</H3>

<P><A NAME="2511"></A>The LSF Base API (LSLIB) allows application programmers
to get services provided by LIM and RES. The services include:</P>

<H4><A NAME="2650"></A>Configuration Information Service</H4>

<P><A NAME="44695"></A>This set of function calls provide information about
the LSF cluster configuration, such as hosts belonging to the cluster,
total amount of installed resources on each host (for example, number of
CPUs, amount of physical memory, and swap space), special resources associated
with individual hosts, and types and models of individual hosts. </P>

<P><A NAME="2764"></A>Such information is static and is collected by LIMs
on individual hosts. By calling these routines, an application gets a global
view of the distributed system. This information can be used for various
purposes. For example, the LSF command <TT>lshosts</TT> displays such information
on the screen. LSF Batch also uses such information to know how many CPUs
are on each host.</P>

<P><A NAME="3064"></A>Flexible options are available for an application
to select the information that is of interest to it.</P>

<H4><A NAME="3043"></A>Dynamic Load Information Service</H4>

<P><A NAME="3046"></A>This set of function calls provide comprehensive
dynamic load information collected from individual hosts periodically.
The load information is provided in the form of load indices detailing
the load on various resources of each host, such as CPU, memory, I/O, disk
space, and interactive activities. Since a site-installed External LIM
(ELIM) can be optionally plugged into the LIM to collect additional information
that is not already collected by the LIM, this set of services can be used
to collect virtually any type of dynamic information about individual hosts.
</P>

<P><A NAME="3146"></A>Example applications that use such information include
<TT>lsload</TT>, <TT>lsmon</TT>, and <TT>xlsmon</TT>. This information
is also valuable to an application in making intelligent job scheduling
decisions. For example, LSF Batch uses such information to decide whether
or not a job should be sent to a host for execution.</P>

<P><A NAME="3099"></A>These service routines provide powerful mechanism
for selecting the information that is of interest to the application.</P>

<H4><A NAME="3264"></A>Placement Advice Service</H4>

<P><A NAME="3342"></A>LSF Base API provides functions to select the best
host among all the hosts. The selected host can then be used to run a job
or to login to. LSF provides flexible syntax for an application to specify
the resource requirements or criteria for host selection and sorting. </P>

<P><A NAME="3380"></A>Many LSF utilities use these functions for placement
decisions, such as <TT>lsrun</TT>, <TT>lsmake</TT>, and <TT>lslogin</TT>.
It is also possible for an application to get the detailed load information
about the candidate hosts together with a preference order of the hosts.</P>

<P><A NAME="3429"></A>A parallel application can ask for multiple hosts
in one LSLIB call for the placement of a multi-component job.</P>

<P><A NAME="3439"></A>The performance differences between different models
of machines as well as the number of CPUs on each host are taken into consideration
when placement advice is made, with the goal of selecting qualified host(s)
that will provide the best performance. </P>

<H4><A NAME="41165"></A>Task List Manipulation Service</H4>

<P><A NAME="41336"></A>Task lists are used to store default resource requirements
for users. LSF provides functions to manipulate the task lists and retrieve
resource requirements for a task. This is important for applications that
need to automatically pick up the resource requirements from user's task
list. The LSF command <TT>lsrtasks</TT> uses these functions to manipulate
user's task list. LSF utilities such as <TT>lstcsh</TT>, <TT>lsrun</TT>,
and <TT>bsub</TT> automatically pick up the resource requirements of the
submitted command line by calling these LSLIB functions.</P>

<H4><A NAME="3237"></A>Master Election Service</H4>

<P><A NAME="25286"></A>If your application needs some kind of fault tolerance,
you can make use of the master election service provided by the LIM. For
example, you can run one copy of your application on every host and only
allow the copy on the master host to be the primary copy and others to
be backup copies. LSLIB provides a function that tells you the name of
the current master host.</P>

<P><A NAME="25360"></A>LSF Batch uses this service to achieve improved
availability. As long as one host in the LSF cluster is up, LSF Batch service
will continue.</P>

<H4><A NAME="25379"></A>Remote Execution Service</H4>

<P><A NAME="25275"></A>The remote execution service provides a transparent
and efficient mechanism for running sequential as well as parallel jobs
on remote hosts. The services are provided by the RES on the remote host
in cooperation with the Network I/O Server (NIOS) on the local host. The
NIOS is a per application stub process that handles the details of the
terminal I/O and signals on the local side. NIOS is always automatically
started by the LSLIB as needed. </P>

<P><A NAME="25466"></A>RES runs as root and runs tasks on behalf of all
users in the LSF cluster. Proper authentication is handled by RES before
running a user task.</P>

<P><A NAME="25465"></A>LSF utilities such as <TT>lsrun</TT>, <TT>lsgrun</TT>,
<TT>ch</TT>, <TT>lsmake</TT>, and <TT>lstcsh</TT> use the remote execution
service. </P>

<H4><A NAME="25440"></A>Remote File Operation Service</H4>

<P><A NAME="25507"></A>The remote file operation service allows load sharing
applications to operate on files stored on remote machines. Such services
extend the UNIX file operation services so that files that are not shared
among hosts can also be accessed by distributed applications transparently.
</P>

<P><A NAME="25575"></A>LSLIB provides routines that are extensions to the
UNIX file operations such as <TT>open</TT>(<TT>2</TT>), <TT>close</TT>(<TT>2</TT>),
<TT>read</TT>(<TT>2</TT>), <TT>write</TT>(<TT>2</TT>), <TT>fseek</TT>(<TT>3</TT>),
and <TT>stat</TT>(<TT>2</TT>).</P>

<P><A NAME="25606"></A>The LSF utility <TT>lsrcp</TT> is implemented with
the remote file operation service functions.</P>

<H4><A NAME="25682"></A>Administration Service</H4>

<P><A NAME="25562"></A>These set of function calls allow application programmers
to write tools for administrating the LSF servers. The operations include
reconfiguring the LSF clusters, shutting down a particular LSF server on
some host, restarting an LSF server on some host, turning logging on or
off, locking/unlocking a LIM on a host, etc.</P>

<P><A NAME="25668"></A>The <TT>lsadmin</TT> and <TT>xlsadmin</TT> utilities
use the administration services.</P>

<H3><A NAME="25975"></A>LSF Batch API Services</H3>

<P><A NAME="8710"></A>The LSF Batch API, LSBLIB gives application programmers
access to the job queueing processing services provided by the LSF Batch
servers. All LSF Batch user interface utilities are built on top of LSBLIB.
The services that are available through LSBLIB include:</P>

<H4><A NAME="26034"></A>LSF Batch System Information Service</H4>

<P><A NAME="26031"></A>This set of function calls allow applications to
get information about LSF Batch system configuration and status. These
include host, queue, and user configurations and status. </P>

<P><A NAME="26081"></A>The batch configuration information determines the
resource sharing policies that dictate the behavior of the LSF Batch scheduling.
</P>

<P><A NAME="26160"></A>The system status information reflects the current
status of hosts, queues, and users of the LSF Batch system.</P>

<P><A NAME="26169"></A>Example utilities that use the LSF Batch configuration
information services are <TT>bhosts</TT>, <TT>bqueues</TT>, <TT>busers</TT>,
<TT>bparams</TT>, and <TT>xlsbatch</TT>.</P>

<H4><A NAME="26123"></A>Job Manipulation Service</H4>

<P><A NAME="26337"></A>The job manipulation service allows LSF Batch application
programmers to write utilities that operate on user jobs. The operations
include job submission, signaling, status checking, checkpointing, migration,
queue switching, and parameter modification. </P>

<H4><A NAME="26475"></A>Log File Processing Service</H4>

<P><A NAME="26493"></A>LSBLIB provides convenient routines for handling
log files used by LSF Batch. These routines return the records logged in
the <TT>lsb.events</TT> and <TT>lsb.acct</TT> files. The records are stored
in well-defined data structures.</P>

<P><A NAME="26528"></A>The LSF Batch commands <TT>bhist</TT> and <TT>bacct</TT>
are implemented with these routines.</P>

<H4><A NAME="26539"></A>LSF Batch Administration Service</H4>

<P><A NAME="26548"></A>This set of function calls are useful for writing
LSF Batch administration tools. The LSF Batch command <TT>badmin</TT> is
implemented with these library calls.</P>

<H4><A NAME="44779"></A>Calendar Manipulation Service</H4>

<P><A NAME="44780"></A>These library calls are used only if you are using
the LSF JobScheduler. These function calls allow programmers to write utilities
that create, check, or change LSF&nbsp;Batch calendars. All the calendar-related
user interface commands of the LSF JobScheduler make use of the calendar
manipulation functions of the LSF Batch API.</P>

<H2><A NAME="28765"></A>Getting Started with LSF Programming</H2>

<P><A NAME="41591"></A>LSF programming is like any other system programming.
You are assumed to have UNIX operating system and C programming knowledge
to understand the concepts involved. </P>

<H3><A NAME="29644"></A><TT>lsf.conf</TT> File</H3>

<P><A NAME="44793"></A>This guide frequently refers to the file <TT>lsf.conf</TT>
for definitions of some parameters. <TT>lsf.conf</TT> is a generic reference
file containing definitions of directories and parameters. <TT>lsf.conf</TT>
is by default installed in <TT>/etc</TT>. If it is not installed in <TT>/etc</TT>,
it is expected that all users of LSF set the environment variable <TT>LSF_ENVDIR</TT>
to point to the directory in which <TT>lsf.conf</TT> is installed. Refer
to <A HREF="10-lsf-reference.html">'LSF Base Configuration Reference'</A>
in the <I><A HREF="admin-title.html">LSF Administrator's Guide</A></I>
for more details about the <TT>lsf.conf file.</TT></P>

<H3><A NAME="28958"></A>LSF Header Files</H3>

<P><A NAME="29450"></A>All LSF header files are installed in the directory
<TT>LSF_INCLUDEDIR/lsf</TT>, where <TT>LSF_INCLUDEDIR</TT> is defined in
the file <TT>lsf.conf</TT>. The programmer should include <TT>LSF_INCLUDEDIR</TT>
in the include file search path, such as that specified by the '<TT>-Idir</TT>'
option of some compilers or pre-processors. </P>

<P><A NAME="41607"></A>There is one header file for LSLIB, the LSF Base
API, and one header file for LSBLIB, the LSF Batch API. </P>

<H4><A NAME="29009"></A><TT>lsf.h</TT></H4>

<P><A NAME="29103"></A>An LSF application must include <TT>&lt;lsf/lsf.h&gt;</TT>
before any of the LSF Base API services are called. <TT>lsf.h</TT> contains
definitions about constants, data structures, error codes, LSLIB function
prototypes, macros, etc, that are used by all LSF applications. </P>

<H4><A NAME="28816"></A><TT>lsbatch.h</TT></H4>

<P><A NAME="29345"></A>An LSF Batch application must include <TT>&lt;lsf/lsbatch.h&gt;</TT>
before any of the LSF Batch API services are called. <TT>lsbatch.h</TT>
contains definitions of constants, data structures, error codes, LSBLIB
function prototypes, macros, etc., that are used by all LSF Batch applications.
</P>

<P><A NAME="41620"></A>There is no need to explicitly include <TT>&lt;lsf/lsf.h&gt;</TT>
in an LSF Batch application because <TT>lsbatch.h</TT> already includes
<TT>&lt;lsf/lsf.h&gt;</TT>.</P>

<H3><A NAME="29584"></A>Linking Applications with LSF APIs</H3>

<P><A NAME="29610"></A>LSF API functions are contained in two libraries,
<TT>liblsf.a</TT> (LSLIB) and <TT>libbat.a</TT> (LSBLIB) for all UNIX platforms.
For Windows NT, the file names of these libraries are <TT>liblsf.lib</TT>
(LSLIB) and <TT>libbat.lib</TT> (LSBLIB), respectively. These files are
installed in <TT>LSF_LIBDIR</TT>, where <TT>LSF_LIBDIR</TT> is defined
in the file <TT>lsf.conf</TT>.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="30022"></A><B>Note<BR>
</B><TT>LSBLIB</TT><I> is not independent by itself. It must always be
linked together with </I><TT>LSLIB</TT><I>. This is because </I><TT>LSBLIB</TT><I>
services are built on top of </I><TT>LSLIB</TT><I> services.</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="30235"></A>LSF uses BSD sockets for communications across the
network. On systems that have both System V and BSD programming interfaces,
LSLIB and LSBLIB typically use the BSD programming interface. On System
V-based versions of UNIX, for example Solaris, it is normally necessary
to link applications using LSLIB or LSBLIB with the BSD compatibility library.
On Windows NT, a number of libraries are needed to be linked together with
LSF API. Details of these additional linkage specifications are shown in
<A HREF="1-introduction.html#46488">Table 1</A>. </P>

<P><A NAME="48567"></A>The <TT>LSF_MISC/examples</TT> directory contains

<H3><A NAME="46483"></A>Error Handling</H3>

<P><A NAME="30972"></A>LSF API uses error numbers to indicate an error.
There are two global variables that are accessible from the application.
These variables are used in exactly the same way UNIX system call error
number variable <TT>errno</TT> is used. The error number should only be
tested when an LSLIB or LSBLIB call fails.</P>

<H4><A NAME="31651"></A><TT>lserrno</TT></H4>

<P><A NAME="31708"></A>An LSF program should test whether an LSLIB call
is successful or not by checking the return value of the call instead of
<TT>lserrno</TT>. </P>

<P><A NAME="31652"></A>When any LSLIB function call fails, it sets the
global variable <TT>lserrno</TT> to indicate the cause of the error. The
programmer can either call <TT>ls_perror()</TT> to print the error message
explicitly to the <I>stderr</I>, or call <TT>ls_sysmsg()</TT> to get the
error message string corresponding to the current value of <TT>lserrno.</TT></P>

<P><A NAME="31450"></A>Possible values of <TT>lserrno</TT> are defined
in <TT>lsf.h</TT>.</P>

<H4><A NAME="31425"></A><TT>lsberrno</TT></H4>

<P><A NAME="31445"></A>This variable is very similar to <TT>lserrno</TT>
except that it is set by LSBLIB whenever an LSBLIB call fails. Programmers
can either call <TT>lsb_perror()</TT> to find out why an LSBLIB call failed
or use <TT>lsb_sysmsg()</TT> to get the error message corresponding to
the current value of <TT>lsberrno</TT>.</P>

<P><A NAME="35278"></A>This simple example gets the name of the LSF cluster

returns the name of the local cluster. In case this call fails, it returns
NULL pointer. <TT>ls_perror()</TT> prints the error message corresponding
to the most recently failed LSLIB function call.</P>

<P><A NAME="44848"></A>The above program would produce output similar to
the following:</P>

<P><A NAME="36192"></A>This example gets LSF Batch parameters and prints

<H2><A NAME="8311"></A>Authentication</H2>

<P><A NAME="1737"></A>LSF programming is distributed programming. Since
LSF services are provided network-wide, it is important for LSF to deliver
the service without compromising the system security. </P>

<P><A NAME="36217"></A>LSF supports several user authentication protocols.
Support for these protocols are described in the section <A HREF="03-concepts.html#3353">'Remote
Execution Control'</A> of the <I><A HREF="admin-title.html">LSF Administrator's
Guide</A></I>. Your LSF administrator can configure the LSF cluster to
use any of the protocols supported. </P>

<P><A NAME="36332"></A>Note that only those LSF API function calls that
operate on user jobs, user data, or LSF servers require authentication.
Function calls that return information about the system do not need to
be authenticated. LSF API calls that must be authenticated are identified
in <A HREF="a-functions.html#1074">'List of LSF API Functions'</A>. </P>

<P><A NAME="36226"></A>The most commonly used authentication protocol,
the privileged port protocol, requires that load sharing applications be
installed as setuid programs. This means that your application has to be
owned by root with the suid bit set. </P>

<P><A NAME="36227"></A>If you need to frequently change and relink your
applications with LSF API, you can consider using the <TT>ident</TT> protocol
which does not require applications to be setuid programs. </P>
