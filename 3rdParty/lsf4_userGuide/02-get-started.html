<P>
<HR></P>

<P><A NAME="3276"></A>This chapter describes how to use some of the basic
features of LSF. After following the examples in this chapter you should
be able to use LSF for most of the everyday tasks.</P>

<P><A NAME="5183"></A>Configuration options shown in the following examples,
such as host types and model names, host CPU factors (representing relative
processor speed), and resource names are examples only; your system likely
has different values for these settings.</P>

<H2><A NAME="1883"></A>Getting Cluster Information</H2>

<P><A NAME="399"></A>Cluster information includes the cluster master host,
cluster name, cluster resource definitions, cluster administrator, etc.
</P>

<H3><A NAME="1546"></A>Displaying the Cluster and Master Names</H3>

<P><A NAME="400"></A>LSF provides tools for users to get information about
the system. The first command you want to use when you learn LSF is <TT>lsid</TT>.
This command tells you the version of LSF, the name of your LSF cluster,
and the current master host.</P>

<P><A NAME="1539"></A>The <TT>lsinfo</TT> command displays three lists
of information: </P>

<UL>
<LI><A NAME="1540"></A>Available resource names in the system </LI>

<LI><A NAME="1541"></A>Available host types </LI>

<LI><A NAME="1542"></A>Available host models </LI>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="1543"></A>The resources listed by <TT>lsinfo</TT> include built-in
resources maintained by the LIM and site specific resources configured
by the LSF administrator. For a complete description of how LSF manages
resources, see <A HREF="04-resources.html#356">'Resources'</A>.</P>

<P><A NAME="13342"></A>The host types and host models are defined by the
LSF administrator. Host types represent binary compatible hosts; all hosts
of the same type can run the same executables. Host models give the relative
CPU performance of different processors. In this example, your LSF cluster
treats an <TT>R10K</TT> processor as being twice as fast as an IBM 350
processor<SUP><A HREF="02-get-started.html#13348">1.</A></SUP>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="13349"></A>Getting Host Information</H2>

<P><A NAME="1554"></A>LSF keeps information about all hosts in the cluster.
Some information is static and some is dynamic. Static information is either
configured by the LSF administrator, or is a fixed property of the system.
An example of static host information is the amount of RAM memory available
to users on a host.</P>

<P><A NAME="3875"></A>Dynamic host information, or load indices, is determined
by the LSF system, and updated regularly. Dynamic information represents
the changing resources available on the host. Examples of dynamic host
information are the current CPU load and the currently available temporary
file space.</P>

<H3><A NAME="402"></A>Displaying Static Host Information</H3>

<P><A NAME="1823"></A>A load sharing cluster may consist of hosts of differing
architecture and speed. The <TT>lshosts</TT> command displays configuration
information about hosts. All these parameters are defined by the LSF administrator
in the LSF configuration files, or determined by the LIM directly from
the system.</P>

<P><A NAME="6899"></A>The first line lists the load index names, and each
following line gives the load levels for one host. The <TT>r15s</TT>, <TT>r1m</TT>
and <TT>r15m</TT> fields give the CPU load, averaged over different time
intervals. The <TT>ut</TT> field gives the percentage of time the CPU is
in use. <TT>pg</TT> is the paging rate, <TT>ls</TT> is the number of login
sessions, <TT>it</TT> is the idle time (the time since the last interactive
user activity), <TT>swp</TT> is the available swap space in megabytes,
<TT>mem</TT> is the available RAM in megabytes, and <TT>tmp</TT> is the
available temporary disk space in megabytes.</P>

<P><A NAME="4233"></A>The <TT>status</TT> column gives the load status
of the host. A host is busy if any load index is beyond its configured
threshold. When a load index is beyond its threshold, it is printed with
an asterisk '<TT>*</TT>'. In the above example, <I>hostA</I> is busy because
load indices <TT>r15s</TT> and <TT>pg</TT> are too high. The <TT>lshosts
-l</TT> command shows the load thresholds.</P>

<P><A NAME="4253"></A>Hosts with <TT>ok</TT> status are listed first. The
<TT>ok</TT> hosts are sorted based on CPU and memory load, with the best
host listed first.</P>

<P><A NAME="4202"></A>The <TT>lsload</TT> command reports more load indices
if the <TT>-l</TT> option is given.</P>

<P><A NAME="443"></A>The <TT>lsmon</TT> command provides an updating display
of load information. The <TT>xlsmon</TT> command is an X-windows graphical
display of host status and load levels in your LSF cluster.</P>

<P><A NAME="12788"></A>See the <TT>lsload</TT>(<TT>1</TT>), <TT>lsmon</TT>(<TT>1</TT>),
and <TT>xlsmon</TT>(<TT>1</TT>) manual pages for more information. Also
see <A HREF="03-cluster-info.html#2707">'Displaying the Load'</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="1946"></A>Running Jobs</H2>

<P><A NAME="1598"></A>LSF supports transparent execution of jobs on all
server hosts in the cluster. You can run your program on the best available
host and interact with it just as if it were running directly on your workstation.
Keyboard signals such as <B><FONT SIZE=-1>CTRL-Z</FONT></B>&nbsp;and <B><FONT SIZE=-1>CTRL-C</FONT></B>&nbsp;work
as expected.</P>

<H3><A NAME="1564"></A>Running Jobs on Remote Hosts</H3>

<P><A NAME="1566"></A>There are different ways to run jobs on a remote
host. To run <TT>myjob</TT> on the best available host, enter:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1567"></A>% <B>lsrun myjob</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1568"></A>LSF automatically selects the best host that is of
the same type as the local host.</P>

<P><A NAME="1569"></A>If you want to run <TT>myjob</TT> on a host with
specific resources, you must specify the resource requirements. For example,</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1570"></A>% <B>lsrun -R 'cserver &amp;&amp; swp&gt;100' myjob</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1573"></A>runs <TT>myjob</TT> on a host that has resource '<TT>cserver</TT>'
(see <A HREF="02-get-started.html#1535">'Displaying Available Resources'</A>)
and has at least 100 megabytes of virtual memory available.</P>

<P><A NAME="1578"></A>If you want to run your job on a particular host,
use the <TT>-m</TT> option:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1579"></A>% <B>lsrun -m hostD myjob</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="7014"></A>When you run an interactive job on a remote host,
you can do most of the job controls as if it were running locally. If your
shell supports job control, you can suspend and resume the job and bring
the job to background or foreground as if it were a local job. For a complete
description, see the <TT>lsrun(1)</TT> manual page.</P>

<P><A NAME="7015"></A>You can also write one-line shell scripts or <TT>csh</TT>
aliases to hide the remote execution. For example:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="11864"></A>#! /bin/sh
# Script to remote execute myjob
exec lsrun -m hostD myjob</PRE>

<P><A NAME="11850"></A>or</P>

<PRE><A NAME="7020"></A>% <B>alias myjob &quot;lsrun -m hostD myjob&quot;</B></PRE>

<H3><A NAME="7141"></A>Load Sharing Commands With <TT>lstcsh</TT></H3>

<P><A NAME="4430"></A>The <TT>lstcsh</TT> shell is a load-sharing version
of the <TT>tcsh</TT> command interpreter. It is compatible with <TT>csh</TT>
and supports many useful extensions. <TT>csh</TT> and <TT>tcsh</TT> users
can use <TT>lstcsh</TT> to send jobs to other hosts in the cluster without
needing to learn any new commands. You can run <TT>lstcsh</TT> from the
command line, or use the <TT>chsh</TT> command to set it as your login
shell. Refer to <A HREF="09-lstcsh.html#16352">'Using <TT>lstcsh</TT>'</A>
for a more detailed description.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4434"></A>Parallel Processing With <TT>lsmake</TT></H3>

<P><A NAME="4449"></A><TT>lsmake</TT> is a load-sharing, parallel version
of GNU <TT>make</TT>. It is compatible with <I>makefiles</I> for most versions
of <TT>make</TT>. <TT>lsmake</TT> uses the LSF load information to choose
the best group of hosts for your make job. Targets in the <I>makefile</I>
are processed in parallel on the chosen hosts using the LSF remote execution
facilities. You do not need to modify your <I>makefile</I> to use <TT>lsmake</TT>.
By default, <TT>lsmake</TT> chooses hosts that are all of the same type.</P>

<P><A NAME="9387"></A>The following example uses the <TT>lsmake -V</TT>
and <TT>-j 3</TT> options to run on three hosts and produce verbose output:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="5909"></A>% <B>lsmake -V -j 3
</B>[hostA] [hostD] [hostK]
&lt;&lt; Execute on local host &gt;&gt;
cc -O -c arg.c -o arg.o
&lt;&lt; Execute on remote host hostA &gt;&gt;
cc -O -c dev.c -o dev.o
&lt;&lt; Execute on remote host hostK &gt;&gt;
cc -O -c main.c -o main.o
&lt;&lt; Execute on remote host hostD &gt;&gt;
cc -O arg.o dev.o main.o</PRE>

<P><A NAME="4536"></A><TT>lsmake</TT> includes control over parallelism
for recursive makes, which are often used for source code trees that are
organized into subdirectories. Parallelism can also be controlled by the
load on the NFS file server, so that parallel makes do not overload the
server and slow everyone else down. See <A HREF="10-lsmake.html#12212">'Using
lsmake'</A> for details.</P>

<H2><A NAME="12712"></A>Batch Processing</H2>

<H3><A NAME="12714"></A>Listing Hosts</H3>

<P><A NAME="12808"></A>LSF Batch uses some (or all) of the hosts in an
LSF cluster as batch server hosts. The host list is configured by the LSF
administrator. The <TT>bhosts</TT> command displays information about these
hosts.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="8913"></A>% <B>bhosts

<P><A NAME="4709"></A><TT>STATUS</TT> gives the status of <TT>sbatchd</TT>.
If a host is down or its <TT>sbatchd</TT> is not up, its <TT>STATUS</TT>
is '<TT>unavail</TT>'. The <TT>JL/U</TT> column shows the maximum number
of job slots a single user can use on each host at one time. <TT>MAX</TT>
gives the maximum number of job slots that are configured for each host.
The <TT>RUN</TT>, <TT>SSUSP</TT>, and <TT>USUSP</TT> columns display the
number of job slots in use by jobs in <TT>RUN</TT> state, suspended by
the system, and suspended by the user, respectively. The field <TT>RSV</TT>
shows job slots that are reserved by LSF Batch for some jobs. The <TT>NJOBS</TT>
field shows the sum of field <TT>RUN</TT>, <TT>SSUSP</TT>, <TT>USUSP</TT>,
and <TT>RSV</TT>.</P>

<P><A NAME="4723"></A>For a more detailed description of the <TT>bhosts</TT>
command see <A HREF="05-lsbatch.html#3189">'Batch Hosts'</A>.</P>

<H3><A NAME="4717"></A>Submitting a Job</H3>

<P><A NAME="1637"></A>To submit a job to the LSF Batch system, use the
<TT>bsub</TT> command.</P>

<P><A NAME="13047"></A>For example, submit the job <TT>sleep 30</TT>. This
command does nothing, and takes 30 seconds to do it. The LSF administrator
configures one queue to be the <I>default job queue</I>; if you submit
a job without specifying a queue, the job goes to the default queue.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="8347"></A>% <B>bsub sleep 30
</B>Job &lt;1234&gt; is submitted to default queue &lt;normal&gt;</PRE>

<P><A NAME="1639"></A>In the above example, <TT>1234</TT> is the job ID
assigned by LSF Batch to this job, and <TT>normal</TT> is the name of the
default job queue.</P>

<P><A NAME="5265"></A>Your batch job remains pending until all conditions
for its execution are met. Each batch queue has execution conditions that
apply to all jobs in the queue, and you can specify additional conditions
when you submit the job.</P>

<P><A NAME="6060"></A>The <TT>-m &quot;</TT><I>host1</I><TT> </TT><I>host2</I><TT>
...&quot;</TT> option specifies that the job must run on one of the specified
hosts. By specifying a single host, you can force your job to wait until
that host is available and then run on that host.</P>

<P><A NAME="6024"></A>For a detailed description of the <TT>bsub</TT> command
see <A HREF="06-submitting.html#343">'Submitting Batch Jobs'</A>.</P>

<H3><A NAME="1753"></A>Selecting a Job Queue </H3>

<P><A NAME="1683"></A><I>Job queues</I> represent different job scheduling
and control policies. All jobs submitted to the same queue share the same
scheduling and control policy. Each job queue can use a configured subset
of the server hosts in the LSF cluster; the default is to use all server
hosts.</P>

<P><A NAME="1684"></A>System administrators can configure job queues to
control resource access by different users and types of application. Users
select the job queue that best fits each job.</P>

<P><A NAME="1687"></A>The <TT>bqueues</TT> command lists the available
LSF Batch queues:</P>

<P><A NAME="1708"></A>A dash '-' in any entry means that the column does
not apply to the row. In this example some queues have no per-queue, per-user
or per-processor job limits configured, so the <TT>MAX</TT>, <TT>JL/U</TT>
