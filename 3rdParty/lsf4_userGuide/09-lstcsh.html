<H1><A NAME="16352"></A>Chapter 9. <A NAME="16350"></A>Using <TT>lstcsh</TT></H1>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P><A NAME="2621"></A>This chapter describes <TT>lstcsh</TT>, an extended
version of the <TT>tcsh</TT> command interpreter. The <TT>lstcsh</TT> interpreter
provides transparent load sharing of user jobs.</P>

<P><A NAME="2859"></A>This chapter is not a general description of the
<TT>tcsh</TT> shell; only the load sharing features are described in detail.</P>

<P><A NAME="2941"></A><TT>lstcsh</TT> is a convenient way for you to take
advantage of LSF. Your commands are sent transparently for execution on
faster hosts to improve response time or you can run commands on remote
hosts explicitly.</P>

<P><A NAME="2942"></A>Resource requirements for specific commands can be
configured using task lists; see <A HREF="04-resources.html#2438">'Configuring
Resource Requirements'</A>. Remote execution is transparent to the user;
keyboard signals such as <B><FONT SIZE=-1>CTRL-Z</FONT></B> and <B><FONT SIZE=-1>CTRL-C</FONT></B>&nbsp;are
automatically sent to the remote task. </P>

<H2><A NAME="2984"></A>Starting <TT>lstcsh</TT></H2>

<P><A NAME="2867"></A>If you normally use some other shell, you can start
<TT>lstcsh</TT> from the command line. Make sure that the LSF commands
are in your <TT>PATH</TT> environment variable and then enter <TT>lstcsh</TT>.
If you have a <TT>.cshrc</TT> file in your home directory, <TT>lstcsh</TT>
reads it to set variables and aliases. Use the <TT>exit</TT> command to
get out of <TT>lstcsh</TT>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="2997"></A>Using <TT>lstcsh</TT> as Your Login Shell</H2>

<P><A NAME="2551"></A>If your system administrator allows, you can use
LSF as your login shell. The <TT>/etc/shells</TT> file contains a list
of all the shells you are allowed to use as your login shell. The <TT>chsh</TT>
command can set your login shell to any of those shells. If the <TT>/etc/shells</TT>
file does not exist, you cannot set your login shell to <TT>lstcsh</TT>.</P>

<P><A NAME="5458"></A>For example, <I>user3</I> can run the command:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="5475"></A>% <B>chsh user3 /usr/local/lsf/bin/lstcsh</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="5535"></A>The next time <I>user3</I> logs in, the login shell
will be <TT>lstcsh</TT>.</P>

<P><A NAME="5584"></A>If you cannot set your login shell using <TT>chsh</TT>,
you can use one of the standard system shells to start <TT>lstcsh</TT>
when you log in. The easiest way is to use <TT>chsh</TT> to set <TT>/bin/sh</TT>
to be your login shell and then edit the <TT>.profile</TT> file in your
home directory to start <TT>lstcsh</TT>, as shown in <A HREF="09-lstcsh.html#5584">Figure
14</A>.</P>

</TABLE>

<H2><A NAME="3032"></A>Automatic Remote Execution</H2>

<P><A NAME="2752"></A>Every time you enter a command, <TT>lstcsh</TT> looks
in your task lists to determine whether the command can be executed on
a remote host and to find the configured resource requirements for the
command. See <A HREF="04-resources.html#2438">'Configuring Resource Requirements'</A>
for more information about task lists.</P>

<P><A NAME="6064"></A>If the command can be executed on a remote host,
<TT>lstcsh</TT> calls the LIM to find the best available host. The first
time a command is run on a remote host, a server shell is started on that
host. The command is sent to the server shell, and the server shell starts
the command on the remote host. All commands sent to the same host use
the same server shell, so the start-up overhead is only incurred once.</P>

<P><A NAME="6186"></A>If no host is found that meets the resource requirements
of your command, it is run on the local host.</P>

<H2><A NAME="6226"></A>Host Redirection</H2>

<P><A NAME="6613"></A>You can explicitly specify the eligibility of a command
line for remote execution using the '<TT>@</TT>' character. It may be anywhere
in the command line except in the first position ('<TT>@</TT>' as the first
character on the line is used to set the value of shell variables).</P>

<P><A NAME="11843"></A>Host redirection overrides the task lists, so you
can force commands from your local task list to execute on a remote host
or override the resource requirements for a command.</P>

<P><A NAME="6855"></A>'<TT>@</TT>' followed by nothing means that the command
line is eligible for remote execution. '<TT>@</TT>' followed by a host
name forces the command line to be executed on that host. '<TT>@</TT>'
followed by the reserved word <TT>local</TT> forces the command line to
be executed on the local host only. '<TT>@</TT>' followed by '<TT>/</TT>'
and a resource requirement string means that the command is eligible for
remote execution and that the given resource requirements must be used
instead of those in the remote task list.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="14113"></A>% <B>hostname @hostD
</B>&lt;&lt; remote execution on hostD &gt;&gt;
hostD
% <B>hostname @/type==alpha
</B>&lt;&lt; remote execution on hostB &gt;&gt;
hostB</PRE>

<P><A NAME="14015"></A>For ease of use, the host names and the reserved
word <TT>local</TT> following '<TT>@</TT>' can all be abbreviated as long
as they do not cause ambiguity. Similarly, when specifying resource requirements
following the '<TT>@</TT>', it is necessary to use '<TT>/</TT>' only if
the first requirement characters specified are also the first characters
of a host name.</P>

<P><A NAME="16556"></A>You do not have to type in resource requirements
for each command line you type if you put these task names into remote
task list together with their resource requirements by running <TT>lsrtasks</TT>.
</P>

<H2><A NAME="6358"></A>Job Control</H2>

<P><A NAME="7021"></A>Job control in <TT>lstcsh</TT> is the same as in
<TT>tcsh</TT> except for remote background jobs. <TT>lstcsh</TT> numbers
shell jobs separately for each execution host.</P>

<P><A NAME="8666"></A>The output of the built-in command <TT>jobs</TT>
lists the background jobs together with their execution hosts. This break
of transparency is intentional to provide you with more control over your
background jobs.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="8743"></A>% <B>sleep 30 @hostD &amp;
</B>&lt;&lt; remote execution on hostD &gt;&gt;
[1] 27568
% <B>sleep 40 @hostD &amp;
</B>&lt;&lt; remote execution on hostD &gt;&gt;

&lt;hostB&gt;
[1]  + Running                sleep 60</PRE>

<P><A NAME="8711"></A>To bring a remote background job to the foreground,
the host name must be specified together with '<TT>@</TT>', as in the following
example:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="13416"></A>% <B>fg %2 @hostD
</B>&lt;&lt; remote execution on hostD &gt;&gt;
sleep 40</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="13417"></A>Built-in Commands</H2>

<P><A NAME="13418"></A><TT>lstcsh</TT> supports two built-in commands to
control load sharing, <TT>lsmode</TT> and <TT>connect</TT>.</P>

<H3><A NAME="10044"></A>The <TT>lsmode</TT> Command</H3>

<P><A NAME="10077"></A>The <TT>lsmode</TT> command takes a number of arguments
that control how <TT>lstcsh</TT> behaves. With no arguments, <TT>lsmode</TT>
displays the current settings:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="10797"></A>% <B>lsmode
</B>LSF 3.0
Copyright 1992-1996 Platform Computing Corporation
LSF enabled, local mode, LSF on, verbose, no_eligibility_verbose, notiming.</PRE>

<P><A NAME="10114"></A>The <TT>lsmode</TT> command reports that LSF is
<TT>enabled</TT> if <TT>lstcsh</TT> was able to contact the LIM when it
started up. If LSF is <TT>disabled</TT>, no load-sharing features are available.</P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="12002"></A><TT>lsmode [on | off] </TT></DT>

<DD>Turns load sharing on or off. The default is on. </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="16297"></A><TT>lsmode [local | remote] </TT></DT>

<DD>Sets <TT>lstcsh</TT> to use local or remote mode. The default is local.
Refer to <A HREF="09-lstcsh.html#9509">'Modes of Operation'</A> for a description
of local and remote modes. </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="16298"></A><TT>lsmode [e | -e] </TT></DT>

<DD>Turns on (<TT>e</TT>) or off (<TT>-e</TT>) eligibility verbose mode.
If eligibility verbose mode is on, <TT>lstcsh</TT> shows whether the command
is eligible for remote execution, and displays the resource requirement
used if the command is eligible. The default is off. </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="10248"></A><TT>lsmode [v | -v] </TT></DT>

<DD>Turns on (<TT>v</TT>) or off (<TT>-v</TT>) task placement verbose mode.
If verbose mode is on, <TT>lstcsh</TT> displays the name of the host where
the command is run, if the command is not run on the local host. The default
is on. </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="10265"></A><TT>lsmode [t | -t] </TT></DT>

<DD>Turns on (<TT>t</TT>) or off (<TT>-t</TT>) wall clock timing. If timing
is on, the actual response time of the command is printed. This time includes
all remote execution overhead. The default is off. </DD>
</DL>

<H3><A NAME="10282"></A>The <TT>connect</TT> Command</H3>

<P><A NAME="10557"></A><TT>lstcsh</TT> opens a connection to a remote host
when the first command is executed remotely on that host. The same connection
is used for all future remote executions on that host. The <TT>lstcsh</TT>
<TT>connect</TT> command with no argument displays the connections that
are currently open.</P>

<P><A NAME="10648"></A>The <TT>connect</TT> <I>host</I> command creates
a connection to the named host. By connecting to a host before any command
is run, the response time is reduced for the first remote command sent
to that host.</P>

<P><A NAME="11674"></A><TT>lstcsh</TT> has a limited number of ports available
to connect to other hosts. By default each shell can only connect to 15
other hosts.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="10721"></A>% <B>connect
</B>CONNECTED WITH              SERVER SHELL
hostA                             +
% <B>connect hostB
</B>Connected to hostB
% <B>connect
</B>CONNECTED WITH              SERVER SHELL
hostA                             +
hostB                             -</PRE>

<P><A NAME="16293"></A>The server shell is a process created on the remote
host to handle <TT>lstcsh</TT> jobs. The server shell is started when the
first command is executed on the remote host. In the previous example,
the <TT>connect</TT> command created a connection to host hostB, but the
server shell has not started.</P>

<H2><A NAME="9509"></A>Modes of Operation</H2>

<P><A NAME="9084"></A>LSF maintains two task lists for each user, a local
list and a remote list. Commands in the local list must be executed locally.
Commands in the remote list can be executed remotely. If a command is in
neither list, you can choose how <TT>lstcsh</TT> handles the command.</P>

<P><A NAME="9159"></A><TT>lstcsh</TT> has two modes of operation: <I>local</I>
and <I>remote</I>. The local mode is the default mode. In local mode, a
command line is eligible for remote execution only if all of the commands
on the line are present in the remote task list, or if the '<TT>@</TT>'
character is specified on the command line to force it to be eligible.
In remote mode, a command line is considered eligible for remote execution,
if none of the commands on the line is in the local task list.</P>

<P><A NAME="9442"></A>Local mode is conservative and can fail to take advantage
of the performance benefits and load-balancing advantages of LSF. Remote
mode is aggressive and makes more extensive use of LSF. However, remote
mode can cause inconvenience when <TT>lstcsh</TT> tries to send host-specific
commands to other hosts.</P>

<P><A NAME="9486"></A>Using the LSF commands <TT>lsltasks(1)</TT> and <TT>lsrtasks(1)</TT>,
you can inspect and change the memberships of the local and remote task
lists. You can optionally associate resource requirements with each command
in the remote list to help LSF find a suitable execution host for the command.
If there are multiple eligible commands on a command line, their resource
requirements are combined for host selection. See <A HREF="04-resources.html#2010">'Task
List'</A> for more information on using task lists and resource requirements.</P>

<H2><A NAME="6512"></A>Differences from Other Shells</H2>

<P><A NAME="7255"></A>When a command is running in the foreground on a
remote host, all keyboard input (type-ahead) is sent to the remote host.
If the remote command does not read the input, it is lost. <TT>lstcsh</TT>
has no way of knowing whether the remote command reads its standard input.
The only way to provide any input to the command is to send everything
available on the standard input to the remote command in case the remote
command needs it. As a result, any type-ahead entered while a remote command
is running in the foreground, and not read by the remote command, is lost.</P>

<P><A NAME="7183"></A>The '<TT>@</TT>' character has a special meaning
when it is preceded by white space. This means that the '<TT>@</TT>' must
be escaped with a backslash '\' to run commands with arguments that start
with '<TT>@</TT>', like <TT>finger</TT>. This is an example of using finger
to get a list of users on another host:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="11297"></A>% <B>finger @other.domain</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="14742"></A>Normally the <TT>finger</TT> command tries to contact
the named host. Under <TT>lstcsh</TT>, the '<TT>@</TT>' character is interpreted
as a request for remote execution, so the shell tries to contact the RES
on the host other.domain to remote execute the <TT>finger</TT> command.
If this host is not in your LSF cluster, the command fails. When the '<TT>@</TT>'
character is escaped, it is passed to <TT>finger</TT> unchanged and <TT>finger</TT>
behaves as expected.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="7244"></A>% <B>finger \@hostB</B></PRE>

<H2><A NAME="3168"></A>Writing Shell Scripts in <TT>lstcsh</TT></H2>

<P><A NAME="2679"></A>You should write shell scripts in <TT>/bin/sh</TT>
and use the <TT>lstools</TT> commands for load sharing. However, <TT>lstcsh</TT>
can be used to write load-sharing shell scripts.</P>

<P><A NAME="7441"></A>By default, an <TT>lstcsh</TT> script is executed
as a normal <TT>tcsh</TT> script with load-sharing disabled. The <TT>lstcsh
-L</TT> option tells the <TT>lstcsh</TT> that the script should be executed
with load sharing enabled, so individual commands in the script may be
executed on other hosts.</P>

<P><A NAME="11189"></A>There are three different ways to run an <TT>lstcsh</TT>
script with load sharing enabled: run <TT>lstcsh -L </TT>script, start
an interactive <TT>lstcsh</TT> and use the <TT>source</TT> command to read
the script in, or make the script executable and put '<TT>#! /usr/local/lsf/bin/lstcsh
-L</TT>' as the first line of the script (assuming you install <TT>lstcsh</TT>
in the <TT>/usr/local/lsf/bin</TT> directory).</P>

<H2><A NAME="16557"></A>Limitations</H2>

<P><A NAME="16558"></A>A shell is a very complicated application by itself.
<TT>lstcsh</TT> has certain limitations: </P>

<UL>
<LI><A NAME="16559"></A>Native Language System is not supported. To use
this feature of the <TT>tcsh</TT>, you must compile <TT>tcsh</TT> with
<TT>SHORT_STRINGS</TT> defined. This causes complications for characters
flowing across machines. </LI>

<LI><A NAME="16567"></A>Shell variables not propagated across machines.
When you set a shell variable locally, then run a command remotely, the
remote shell will not see that shell variable. Only environment variables
are automatically propagated. </LI>

<LI><A NAME="16629"></A>The <TT>fg</TT> command for remote jobs must use
'<TT>@'</TT>, as shown by examples in <A HREF="09-lstcsh.html#6358">'Job
Control'</A>. </LI>
</UL>
