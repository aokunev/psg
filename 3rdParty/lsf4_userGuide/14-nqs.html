<H1><A NAME="17425"></A>Chapter 14. <A NAME="6969"></A>Interoperation with
NQS</H1>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P><A NAME="17426"></A>The Network Queuing System (NQS) is a UNIX batch
queuing facility that allows users to queue batch jobs to individual UNIX
hosts from remote systems. Many users have been using NQS for years.</P>

<P><A HREF="14-nqs.html#"> <A NAME="24650"></A></A>This chapter describes how LSF
works with existing NQS systems. If you are not going to use LSF to interoperate
with NQS, you do not need to read this chapter.</P>

<P> <A NAME="24173"></A>For user sites who have been using NQS for years,
LSF provides a set of NQS compatible commands for them to submit jobs to
LSF using the NQS command syntax. Examples of NQS compatibility commands
in LSF include <TT>qsub</TT>, <TT>qstat</TT>, and <TT>qdel</TT>.</P>

<P> <A NAME="17524"></A>While it is desirable to run LSF on all hosts for
transparent resource sharing, this is not always possible. Some of the
computing resources may be under separate administrative control, or LSF
may not currently be available for some of the hosts.</P>

<P> <A NAME="21403"></A>An example of this are sites that use Cray supercomputers.
The supercomputer is often not under the control of the workstation system
administrators. Users on the workstation cluster still want to run jobs
on the Cray supercomputer. LSF allows users to submit and control jobs
on the Cray system using the same LSF interface as they use for jobs on
the local cluster.</P>

<P> <A NAME="20828"></A>LSF queues can be configured to forward jobs to
remote NQS queues. Users can submit jobs, send signals to jobs, check status
of jobs, and delete jobs that are forwarded to the remote NQS. Although
running on an NQS server outside the LSF cluster, jobs are still managed
by LSF Batch in almost the same way as jobs running inside the LSF cluster.</P>

<H2><A HREF="14-nqs.html#"> <A NAME="19127"></A></A>Choosing an LSF Batch Queue</H2>

<P><A NAME="21505"></A>To submit jobs to hosts where NQS is running, you
first need to find out which LSF Batch queues are configured to forward
jobs to NQS hosts.The <TT>bqueues -l</TT> command lists detailed information
about all LSF Batch queues. Queues that have the `<TT>NQS DESTINATION QUEUES</TT>'
parameter defined will forward jobs to remote NQS hosts. Below is an example
of the output from the <TT>bqueues</TT> command that describes such a queue:</P>

</B>QUEUE: cray
-- For jobs to be sent to the Cray supercomputer.

<P><A NAME="22250"></A>Note that `<TT>nqs_queue</TT>' in the above output
is the name of the NQS queue on the specified host.</P>

<H2> <A NAME="22251"></A>Submitting a Job from LSF to NQS</H2>

<P><A NAME="21744"></A>Submitting a job to run on an NQS host is the same
as submitting an ordinary LSF job, except that only those options that
reflect common functionality of both LSF and NQS can be used. This is because
some NQS options do not make sense in the LSF context, and many LSF options
are not supported by NQS. Options must be specified as LSF options; they
are automatically translated when the job is forwarded to NQS. See the
LSF <TT>bsub</TT>(<TT>1</TT>) manual page and the NQS <TT>qsub</TT>(<TT>1</TT>)
manual page for more information on the options supported by LSF and NQS.</P>

<H2> <A NAME="19461"></A>Controlling Jobs Running on NQS</H2>

<P><A NAME="19472"></A>Job information from NQS is translated by LSF and
reported by LSF Batch commands. Any signals supported by both LSF and NQS
may be sent to a specified job.</P>

<H2> <A NAME="19486"></A>Forwarding of Output Files</H2>

<P><A NAME="19499"></A>The <TT>stdout</TT> and <TT>stderr</TT> output of
the job is always transferred from the NQS host back to the LSF cluster.
If the <TT>bsub -o</TT> or <TT>-e</TT> options are not specified, the output
of the job is mailed to the user. If either of the <TT>-o</TT> or <TT>-e</TT>
options are specified, the output received from the NQS server is stored
in the specified files.</P>
