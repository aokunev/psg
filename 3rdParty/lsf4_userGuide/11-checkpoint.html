Migration</H1>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P><A NAME="12643"></A>Checkpointing allows you to take a snapshot of the
state of a running batch job, so that the job can be restarted later. There
are two main reasons for checkpointing a job: fault tolerance and load
balancing.</P>

<P><A NAME="17555"></A>A batch job can be checkpointed periodically during
its run. If the execution host goes down for any reason, the job can resume
execution from the last checkpoint when the host comes back up, rather
than having to start from the beginning. The job can also be restarted
on a different host if the original execution host remains unavailable.</P>

<P><A NAME="12645"></A>Sometimes one host is overloaded while the others
are idle or lightly loaded. LSF Batch can checkpoint one or more jobs on
the overloaded host and restart the jobs on other idle or lightly loaded
hosts. Job migration can also be used to move intensive jobs away from
hosts with interactive users such as desktop workstations, so that the
intensive jobs do not interfere with the users.</P>

</UL>

<H2><A NAME="12646"></A>Approaches to Checkpointing</H2>

<P><A NAME="12647"></A>Checkpointing can be implemented at three levels.
These levels are called <I>kernel-level</I>, <I>user-level</I> and <I>application-level</I>.</P>

<P><A NAME="17180"></A>LSF Batch uses the kernel-level support available
on ConvexOS, Cray (UNICOS), and SPP-UX systems to implement checkpointing
on these machines and provides user-level support on most other platforms
(HP-UX 9.x, DEC Alpha, SGI IRIX 5,6, Solaris 2.x, and SunOs 4). It also
supports application-level checkpointing.</P>

<H3><A NAME="12648"></A>Kernel-level Checkpointing</H3>

<P><A NAME="12649"></A>In kernel-level checkpointing, the operating system
supports checkpointing and restarting processes. The checkpointing is transparent
to applications.: they do not have to be modified or linked with any special
library to support checkpointing.</P>

<H3><A NAME="12650"></A>User-level Checkpointing</H3>

<P><A NAME="12651"></A>Application programs to be checkpointed are linked
with a checkpoint user library. Upon checkpointing, a checkpoint triggering
signal is sent to the process. The functions in the checkpoint library
respond to the signal and save the information necessary to restart the
process. On restart, the functions in the checkpoint library restore the
execution environment for the process. To applications, checkpointing is
transparent. But unlike kernel-level support, applications must be relinked
to allow checkpointing.</P>

<H3><A NAME="12652"></A>Application-level Checkpointing</H3>

<P><A NAME="12653"></A>Applications can be coded in a way to checkpoint
themselves either periodically or in response to signals sent by other
processes. When restarted, the application must look for the checkpoint
files and restore its state.</P>

<H3><A NAME="24041"></A>Checkpoint Directory </H3>

<P><A NAME="24045"></A>Checkpoint directory stores checkpoint files that
are necessary to recreate a checkpointed job. LSF allows more than one
job to be checkpointed into the same directory. Each job is saved in a
different subdirectory named by the job ID.</P>

<P><A NAME="24064"></A>LSF Batch automatically renames <TT>chkpntdir/<I>jobId</I></TT>
to <TT>chkpntdir/<I>newjobId</I></TT> after a job is restarted. A conflict
may occur when a directory <TT>chkpntdir/<I>jobId</I></TT> already exists
and the restart jobID is the same as the existing directory. In this case,
LSF Batch first renames the existing directory <TT>chkpntdir/<I>jobId</I></TT>
to <TT>chkpntdir/<I>jobId</I>.bak</TT>.</P>

<P><A NAME="24055"></A>If the conflict cannot be solved, <TT>sbatchd</TT>
will report it to <TT>mbatchd</TT> and the job will be aborted.</P>

<H3><A NAME="23817"></A>Uniform Checkpointing Interface</H3>

<P><A NAME="23803"></A>All interaction between LSF and the platform or
application dependent facility goes through a common interface provided
by two executables: <TT>echkpnt</TT> and <TT>erestart</TT><SUP><A HREF="11-checkpoint.html#23868">1.</A></SUP>.
<TT>echkpnt</TT> is invoked when LSF needs to checkpoint a job. <TT>erestart</TT>
is invoked when LSF needs to start a previously checkpointed job.</P>

<P><A NAME="23812"></A>For systems supporting kernel-level checkpointing,
<TT>echkpnt</TT> and <TT>erestart</TT> are just wrapper scripts for the
vendor's checkpointing commands. User-level checkpointing for the supported
platforms uses whichever <TT>echkpnt</TT>/<TT>erestart</TT> interacts with
the supplied checkpoint library.</P>

<P><A NAME="23848"></A>You can follow the format given below to extend
or replace <TT>echkpnt</TT> and <TT>erestart</TT> for other checkpoint
facilities, including the application-level checkpointing.</P>

<H3><A NAME="23821"></A>The <TT>echkpnt</TT> Command</H3>

<P><A NAME="23823"></A>The <TT>echkpnt</TT> command must support the following
arguments and take appropriate actions to perform the checkpointing:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="23888"></A>echkpnt [-c] [-f] [-k |-s] [-d <I>chkpnt_dir </I>] <I>process-group-id</I></PRE>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="23707"></A><TT>-c </TT></DT>

<DD>Copy all regular files in use by the checkpointed process to the checkpoint
directory. </DD>

<DT><A NAME="23708"></A><TT>-f </TT></DT>

<DD>Checkpoint the job even if non-checkpointable conditions exist (non-checkpointable
conditions are specific to the type of checkpoint facility being used).
This may create checkpoint files that will not restart properly. </DD>

<DT><A NAME="23709"></A><TT>-k </TT></DT>

<DD>Kill the job if the checkpoint operation is successful. Default is
that the job continues execution after being checkpointed. If this option
is specified and the checkpoint fails for any reason, the job continues
normal execution. </DD>

<DT><A NAME="23894"></A><TT>-s </TT></DT>

<DD>Stop the job if the checkpoint operation is successful. Default is
that the job continues execution after being checkpointed. If this option
is specified and the checkpoint fails for any reason, the job continues
normal execution. </DD>

<DT><A NAME="23710"></A><TT>-d <I>chkpnt_dir </I></TT></DT>

<DD>The directory containing the checkpoint files. Default is the current
directory. </DD>

<DT><A NAME="23711"></A><I><TT>process-group-id </TT></I></DT>

<DD>The process group ID of the job to be checkpointed. </DD>
</DL>

<H3><A NAME="23712"></A>The <TT>erestart</TT> Command</H3>

<P><A NAME="23830"></A>The <TT>erestart</TT> command must support the following
arguments and take appropriate actions to perform the restart:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="23713"></A>erestart [-c] [-f]  <I>chkpnt_dir</I> </PRE>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="23714"></A><TT>-c </TT></DT>

<DD>Copy data files from the checkpoint directory to the original pathname.
If any of the process's data files are copied into the checkpoint directory
at the time of checkpoint, this option will cause restart to replace the
contents of the original files with the copies. This option is currently
only supported on ConvexOS. </DD>

<DT><A NAME="23715"></A><TT>-f </TT></DT>

<DD>Force a restart of the process even if non-restartable conditions exist.
</DD>

<DT><A NAME="23716"></A><I><TT>chkpnt_dir </TT></I></DT>

<DD>Checkpoint directory. </DD>
</DL>

<P><A NAME="23720"></A>When LSF Batch calls <TT>erestart</TT>, it will
first pass the process-ID and process group-ID of the original job via
the environment variables <TT>LSB_RESTART_PID</TT> and <TT>LSB_RESTART_PGID</TT>,
respectively. Then it waits for a message from the standard error of erestart
before proceeding. Upon success, <TT>erestart</TT> sends back either a
message of <TT>&quot;pid=NEW_PID pgid=NEW_PGID&quot;</TT> if there are
any restart process-id or process group-id changes, or a null message by
closing the standard error if there are not any changes. On failure, LSF
Batch expects <TT>erestart</TT> will write the error messages via its standard
error.</P>

<H2><A NAME="13676"></A>Submitting Checkpointable Jobs</H2>

<P><A NAME="12661"></A>Checkpointable jobs are submitted using the <TT>-k
&quot;<I>checkpoint_dir</I>[<I>period</I>]&quot;</TT> option of the <TT>bsub</TT>
command. The <I>checkpoint_dir</I> parameter specifies the directory where
the checkpoint files are created. The <I>period</I> parameter specifies
an optional time interval in minutes for automatic and periodic checkpointing.
If the <I>period </I>parameter is specified, the checkpoint directory and
period must be enclosed in quotes.</P>

<P><A NAME="12662"></A>If the checkpoint period is not specified, the job
is considered checkpointable but it is not automatically checkpointed.
A checkpoint can be created for any checkpointable batch job using the
<TT>bchkpnt</TT> command. If the checkpoint period is specified, LSF Batch
automatically checkpoints the job at the specified time interval.</P>

<P><A NAME="14802"></A>This example submits the checkpointable batch job
<TT>io_job</TT>. Checkpoint files will be stored in the directory io.chkdir/3426
(relative to the current directory), and checkpoints will automatically
be created every 10 minutes, each overwriting the previous one.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="22038"></A><B>Note<BR>
</B><I>It is your responsibility to clean up the checkpoint directory when
it is no longer needed.</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="12666"></A>If the checkpoint directory does not exist, LSF
Batch creates it. If it does exist, it must be writable by the user. To
restart a job on a different host, the checkpoint files must be stored
in a directory accessible to both hosts.</P>

<H2><A NAME="12795"></A>Checkpointing a Job</H2>

<P><A NAME="12796"></A>In addition to automatic checkpointing, users can
checkpoint jobs explicitly with the <TT>bchkpnt</TT> command. A job is
checkpointable only if it was submitted with the <TT>-k</TT> option to
<TT>bsub</TT>.</P>

<P><A NAME="17883"></A>The <TT>-p <I>period</I></TT><I> </I>option to <TT>bchkpnt</TT>
allows you to set or change the checkpointing period for a job. <I>period</I>
is specified in minutes. If <I>period </I>is 0 (zero), periodic checkpointing
is turned off. Otherwise, periodic checkpointing is turned on and the checkpoint
period is set to the value given.</P>

<P><A NAME="12798"></A>Some jobs cannot be checkpointed and restarted correctly
because it is not possible to recreate the running state of the job. See
<A HREF="11-checkpoint.html#14114">'Limitations'</A> and the <TT>chkpnt(1)</TT>
manual page on ConvexOS and Cray systems for a list of conditions that
can cause checkpointing to fail.</P>

<P><A NAME="16652"></A>The <TT>-f</TT> option to <TT>bchkpnt</TT> forces
the job to be checkpointed, even if some condition exists that would normally
make the job non-checkpointable. When a non-checkpointable job is checkpointed
using the <TT>-f</TT> flag, the job may not be restarted correctly.</P>

<P><A NAME="12799"></A>The <TT>-k</TT> option to <TT>bchkpnt</TT> checkpoints
and kills the batch job as an atomic action. This guarantees that the job
does not do any processing or I/O after the checkpoint, so that the restarted
job does not repeat any operations already performed by the original job.</P>

<H2><A NAME="12667"></A>Restarting a Checkpointed Job</H2>

<P><A NAME="12668"></A>A checkpointed batch job can be restarted on a host
of the same type as, and running the same operating system version as,
the original execution host. The executable being run and all open files
must be located at the same absolute path name.</P>

<P><A NAME="12669"></A>In addition to automatic job restart, specified
with the <TT>-r</TT> option to <TT>bsub</TT>, LSF Batch provides the <TT>brestart</TT>
command that restarts a checkpointed batch job from the information stored
in the checkpoint directory. The checkpoint directory must have been created
by a previously submitted job that was checkpointed successfully.</P>

<P><A NAME="24068"></A>When you restart a job with <TT>brestart</TT> command,
you should specify a <I>jobId</I> and <I>chkpntDir</I> directory. The command
looks like:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="24069"></A>brestart  <I>chkpntDir</I>  [<I>lastJobId</I>]</PRE>

<P><A NAME="24070"></A>where <I>lastJobId</I> must be specified if there
is more than one <I>jobId</I> directory under <I>chkpntDir</I>.</P>

<P><A NAME="18340"></A><TT>brestart</TT> creates a new batch job that uses
the checkpoint information. The restarted job is assigned a new job ID
number, and is placed at the end of the specified queue. The job begins
executing when a suitable host is available, like any other batch job.</P>

<P><A NAME="18674"></A>The <TT>brestart</TT> command takes many of the
same options as the <TT>bsub</TT> command to specify the conditions under
which the restarted job runs. The restarted job has the same output file
and file transfer specifications, job name, run window signal value, checkpoint
directory and period, and rerunability as the original job.</P>

<P><A NAME="20737"></A>Checkpointable jobs and rerunable jobs (jobs that
are submitted with the <TT>bsub -r</TT> option) can be migrated to another
host for execution if the current host is too busy or the host is going
to be shut down. Such jobs can be moved from one host to another, as long
as both hosts are binary compatible and run the same version of the operating
system.</P>

<P><A NAME="20739"></A>The job's owner or the LSF administrator can use
the <TT>bmig</TT> command to migrate jobs. If the job is checkpointable,
the <TT>bmig</TT> command first checkpoints it. Then LSF kills the running
or suspended job, and restarts or reruns the job on another suitable host
if one is available. If LSF is unable to rerun or restart the job immediately,
the job reverts to <TT>PEND</TT> status and is requeued with a higher priority
than any submitted job, so it is rerun or restarted before other queued
jobs are dispatched.</P>

<H3><A NAME="19942"></A>Queues and Hosts for Automatic Job Migration</H3>

<P><A NAME="19943"></A>LSF Batch will not automatically migrate a job unless
the job has a migration threshold. A job has a migration threshold if it
is dispatched from a queue or to a host that has a migration threshold
defined. The <TT>bqueues -l</TT> and <TT>bhosts -l</TT> commands display
the migration threshold if it is defined.</P>

<H2><A NAME="12674"></A>Automatically Rerunning and Restarting Jobs</H2>

<P><A NAME="12675"></A>Batch jobs submitted with the <TT>-r</TT> option
to the <TT>bsub</TT> command are automatically rerun or restarted if the
execution host becomes unavailable. (A host is considered unavailable if
both the LIM and <TT>sbatchd</TT> daemons are unreachable.) If the job
has not been checkpointed, the job is rerun from the beginning. If the
job has been checkpointed, either automatically or by the <TT>bchkpnt</TT>
command, it is restarted from the last checkpoint.</P>

<P><A NAME="14078"></A>When a job is rerun or restarted, it is returned
to the batch queue in which it was executing, with the same options but
a higher priority as the original batch job. The job uses the same job
ID number. It is executed when a suitable host is available, and an email
message is sent to the job submitter informing the user of the restart.</P>

<H3><A NAME="23931"></A>Submitting a Job for Automatic Migration</H3>

<P><A NAME="23933"></A>If you want to submit a rerunable job and have the
system automatically migrate it to another host when the job is suspended
due to load, you must submit the job to a queue or a host configured for
automatic job migration. </P>

<P><A NAME="23934"></A>If a job with a migration threshold has been suspended
for more than the specified number of minutes, LSF Batch attempts to migrate
the job to another host. Only checkpointable or rerunable jobs are considered
for migration. To submit a rerunable job, you must use the <TT>-r</TT>
option to the <TT>bsub</TT> command.</P>

<P><A NAME="23938"></A>If you want a job to be rerunable but you do not
want the system to migrate it automatically, submit the job to a queue
or host that does not have a migration threshold defined. You can still
migrate the job manually with the <TT>bmig</TT> command.</P>

<H2><A NAME="14043"></A>Building Checkpointable Jobs</H2>

<P><A NAME="14009"></A>The LSF checkpoint library provides user-level checkpointing
facilities on operating systems that do not provide kernel checkpointing.
It consists of three parts: </P>

<UL>
<LI><A NAME="14010"></A>The checkpoint library, <TT>libckpt.a </TT></LI>

<LI><A NAME="14011"></A>The special checkpoint startup routine, <TT>ckpt_crt0.o
</TT></LI>

<LI><A NAME="14012"></A>The checkpoint linkers, <TT>ckpt_ld and ckpt_ld_f
</TT></LI>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="14013"></A>Programs to be checkpointed must be linked with
the checkpoint startup routine and library. The checkpoint linkers are
shell scripts that call the standard linkers on your operating system with
the correct options to link a checkpointable program.</P>

<P><A NAME="14014"></A>The LSF user-level checkpoint library is based on
the Condor system from the University of Wisconsin.</P>

<H3><A NAME="14015"></A>The Checkpoint Library</H3>

<P><A NAME="14016"></A>The checkpoint library consists of a set of file
system call stubs for file operations such as <TT>open()</TT>, <TT>close()</TT>,
and <TT>dup()</TT>, intercepted by the checkpoint library. It also contains
a checkpoint signal handler and routines used internally to implement checkpointing.</P>

<H3><A NAME="14017"></A>The Checkpoint Startup Routine</H3>

<P><A NAME="14018"></A>The startup routine sets the checkpoint signal handler
and initializes some data structures. The data structures are used to record
file accesses of the process and are used during the restart to re-open
files opened before the checkpoint and to restore the current access positions
in those files. The signal handler settings of the process are also saved
at the checkpoint time and restored when the process is restarted. All
these operations are transparent to applications.</P>

<H3><A NAME="14019"></A>Linking</H3>

<P><A NAME="14112"></A>Except on those systems with kernel checkpointing
support, checkpointable programs must be linked with the special checkpoint
library and startup routine instead of the standard ones. LSF comes with
replacement linkers for programs to be checkpointed. The <TT>ckpt_ld</TT>
and <TT>ckpt_ld_f</TT> commands are shell scripts that take the same parameters
as the system linker, <TT>ld</TT>. The checkpoint linkers call <TT>ld</TT>
with the correct flags to link the user's program with the checkpoint library
<TT>libckpt.a</TT> and the special startup routine <TT>ckpt_crt0.o</TT>.
<TT>ckpt_ld</TT> is for linking C programs and <TT>ckpt_ld_f</TT> is for
linking FORTRAN programs.</P>

<P><A NAME="14191"></A>In most cases, users run the compiler for the language
used, and the compiler then invokes the linker on behalf of the user. Because
of this, few users call the linker directly. This section describes the
steps involved in building a checkpointable application.</P>

<P><A NAME="14195"></A>Suppose you have a C program called <TT>prog.c</TT>,
and you normally create an executable, <TT>prog</TT>, as follows:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="14196"></A>% <B>cc -o prog prog.c</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="14197"></A>To build a checkpointable program, however, you
need to build the object file, <TT>prog.o</TT>, as follows:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="14198"></A>% <B>cc -c prog.c</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="14199"></A>Use the LSF linker script to build the executable:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="21250"></A><B>Note<BR>
</B><TT>ckpt_ld</TT><I> requires the static library </I><TT>libc.a</TT><I>
on all platforms. In addition, on AIX version 3.2 it requires </I><TT>libbsd.a</TT><I>;
on Solaris version 2 it requires </I><TT>libmalloc.a, libsocket.a</TT><I>,
</I><TT>libnsl.a</TT><I>, and </I><TT>libintl.a</TT><I>.</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="14201"></A>Like C programs, FORTRAN source files must be compiled
to object files and then linked with the <TT>ckpt_ld_f</TT> command. To
build a checkpointable version of <TT>prog1</TT> from the <TT>prog1.f</TT>
source file, proceed as follows:</P>

<H4><A NAME="21293"></A>Table 5. Static Libraries for ckpt_ld_f</H4>

<P><!-- table 'ere --></P>

<P><A NAME="16153"></A>In addition to the checkpoint library and startup
routine, <TT>ckpt_ld</TT> and <TT>ckpt_ld_f</TT> may also link in a few
other system-provided object files that are platform-dependent. Normally,
these files are installed in a standard directory by the operating system.
However, you may get an error if your system administrator set things up
differently. In this case, see the ckpt_ld(1) manual page for more information.</P>

<H3><A NAME="14114"></A>Limitations</H3>

<P><A NAME="14115"></A>There are restrictions to the use of the current
implementation of the checkpoint library for user level checkpointing.
These are: </P>

<UL>
<LI><A NAME="14116"></A>The checkpointed process can only be restarted
on hosts of the same architecture and running the same operating system
as the host on which the checkpoint was created </LI>

<LI><A NAME="14117"></A>Only single process jobs can be checkpointed </LI>

<LI><A NAME="14118"></A>All file operations must be idempotent </LI>

<LI><A NAME="14119"></A>Processes with open pipes or sockets can be checkpointed
but may not properly restart as the pipes/sockets are not re-opened on
restart </LI>

<LI><A NAME="14120"></A>If a process has <TT>stdin</TT>, <TT>stdout</TT>,
or <TT>stderr</TT> as open pipes, all data in the pipes is lost on restart
</LI>

<LI><A NAME="14131"></A>The checkpointed process cannot be operating on
a private stack when the checkpoint happens </LI>

<LI><A NAME="14136"></A>The checkpointed process cannot use internal timers
</LI>

<LI><A NAME="21127"></A>The checkpointed program must be statically linked.
</LI>

<LI><A NAME="21745"></A><TT>SIGHUP</TT> is used internally to implement
checkpointing. Do not use this signal in programs to be checkpointed. </LI>
</UL>
