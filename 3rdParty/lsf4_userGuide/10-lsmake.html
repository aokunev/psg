<H1><A NAME="12214"></A>Chapter 10. <A NAME="12212"></A>Using <TT>lsmake</TT></H1>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P><A NAME="2621"></A>This chapter describes how to use <TT>lsmake</TT>
to perform parallel software builds and similar tasks.</P>

<P><A NAME="5743"></A><TT>lsmake</TT> is based on GNU <TT>make</TT>, and
supports all GNU <TT>make</TT> features. Additional command line options
control parallel execution. GNU <TT>make</TT> is upwardly compatible with
the <TT>make</TT> programs supplied by most UNIX vendors.</P>

<P><A NAME="2977"></A>To use <TT>lsmake</TT> you do not need to change
your makefile, although reorganizing the contents of the makefile might
increase the parallelism and therefore reduce the running time.</P>

<P><A NAME="10167"></A>The <TT>lsmake(1)</TT> manual page describes the
command line options that control load sharing. The <TT>gmake(1)</TT> manual
pages describes the other command line options.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="12207"></A><B>Note<BR>
</B><I>Interactive tasks, including </I><TT>lsmake</TT><I>, are not supported
on Windows NT.</I></P>

<H2><A NAME="3013"></A>Parallel Execution</H2>

<P><A NAME="2631"></A>Many tasks consist of many subtasks, with dependencies
between the subtasks. For example, compiling a software package requires
compiling each file in the package and then linking all the compiled files
together.</P>

<P><A NAME="4832"></A>In many cases most of the subtasks do not depend
on each other. For a software package, the individual files in the package
can be compiled at the same time; only the linking step needs to wait for
all the other tasks to complete.</P>

<P><A NAME="12190"></A>In an LSF cluster you can use <TT>lsmake</TT> to
select a group of hosts and run parts of your make in parallel.</P>

<H2><A NAME="12192"></A>Invoking <TT>lsmake</TT></H2>

<P><A NAME="8044"></A><TT>lsmake</TT> supports all the GNU <TT>make</TT>
command line options.</P>

<H3><A NAME="5872"></A>Specifying the Number of Processors</H3>

<P><A NAME="5819"></A>The <TT>lsmake -j <I>num_processors</I></TT> option
tells <TT>lsmake</TT> to ask the LIM for <I>num_processors</I> processors.
If fewer processors are available, <TT>lsmake</TT> uses all the available
processors. If no processors are available and the local host meets all
resource requirements specified using the <TT>lsmake -R</TT> option, all
<TT>make</TT> tasks are run on the local host.</P>

<P><A NAME="6039"></A>By default <TT>lsmake</TT> selects the same host
type as the submitting host. This is necessary for most compilation jobs;
all components must be compiled on the same host type and operating system
version to run correctly. If your <TT>make</TT> task requires other resources
you can override the default resource requirements with the <TT>lsmake
-R <I>resreq</I></TT> option.</P>

<P><A NAME="5059"></A>To build your software in parallel on 10 processors,
enter:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="4953"></A>% <B>lsmake -j 10</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="4955"></A>If you want to take advantage of parallelism between
the CPU and I/O on a powerful host, you can also specify the number of
concurrent jobs for each processor using the <TT>lsmake -c</TT> option:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="4956"></A>% <B>lsmake -j 10 -c 2</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="4957"></A>This selects up to 10 processors and starts two tasks
on each processor.</P>

<H2><A NAME="3043"></A>File Server Load</H2>

<P><A NAME="3181"></A><TT>lsmake</TT> can significantly reduce the response
time of your make; however, it may also overload your file server or network
if the jobs you are running are I/O intensive.</P>

<P><A NAME="3182"></A>You can specify a threshold load so that parallelism
is automatically reduced when the file server load is above a threshold
and expanded when the file server load is below the threshold.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="3183"></A>% <B>lsmake -j 10 -F &quot;r15s &lt; 5 &amp;&amp; pg &lt; 20&quot;</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="3184"></A>This <TT>lsmake</TT> job uses up to 10 hosts, and
reduces the parallelism if the file server CPU load <TT>r15s</TT> goes
beyond 5, or if the file server paging rate goes beyond 20 pages per second.
<TT>lsmake</TT> automatically determines the file server for the current
working directory.</P>

<H2><A NAME="3064"></A>Tuning Your Makefile</H2>

<P><A NAME="2941"></A>The smallest unit that <TT>lsmake</TT> runs in parallel
is a single <TT>make</TT> rule. If your makefile has rules that include
many steps, or rules that contain shell loops to build sub-parts of your
project, <TT>lsmake</TT> runs the steps serially.</P>

<P><A NAME="10984"></A>You can increase the parallelism in your makefile
by breaking up complex rules into groups of simpler rules. Steps that must
run in sequence can use <TT>make</TT> dependencies to enforce the order.
<TT>lsmake</TT> can then find more subtasks to run in parallel.</P>

<H2><A NAME="11075"></A>Building in Subdirectories</H2>

<P><A NAME="11077"></A>If your <TT>make</TT> job is divided into subdirectories,
<TT>lsmake -M</TT> can process the subdirectories in parallel. The total
number of parallel tasks is shared over all the subdirectories. Without
the <TT>-M</TT> option, <TT>lsmake</TT> processes subdirectories sequentially,
although tasks within each subdirectory can be run in parallel.</P>

<P><A NAME="11078"></A>To process subdirectories in parallel they must
be built as separate targets in your makefile. You must specify the <TT>make</TT>
command for each subdirectory with the built-in <TT>$(MAKE)</TT> macro
so that <TT>lsmake</TT> can substitute the correct <TT>lsmake</TT> command
for the subdirectory.</P>

<P><A NAME="5241"></A>Some makefiles may work correctly when run on a single
machine, but may not work correctly when run in parallel through <TT>lsmake</TT>.</P>

<P><A NAME="11054"></A><A HREF="10-lsmake.html#11054">Figure 15</A> shows
a makefile rule that uses a shell loop to process subdirectories.</P>

<H4><A NAME="11054"></A>Figure 15. Makefile Rules With Shell Loop</H4>

<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=0 >
<TR>
<TD>
<PRE>DIRS = lib misc main
prog:
       for subdir in $(DIRS) ; do \
              cd $subdir ; $(MAKE) ; cd .. ;\ 
       done</PRE>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P><A NAME="12071"></A>When this makefile is run on a single machine, the
directories are processed sequentially; that is <TT>lib</TT> is built before
<TT>misc</TT> and <TT>main</TT>. However, when run using <TT>lsmake</TT>
using the <TT>-M</TT> option, all directories can be built in parallel.
Therefore, it is possible for the <TT>misc</TT> and <TT>main</TT> directories
to be built before <TT>lib</TT>, which is not correct.</P>

<P><A NAME="7189"></A><A HREF="10-lsmake.html#7189">Figure 16</A> shows
a set of makefile rules to perform the same tasks and allows the subdirectories
to be built in parallel in the correct order. Note that an extra rule is
added so that the <TT>lib</TT> and <TT>misc</TT> subdirectories are built
before the main directory:</P>

<H2><A NAME="6447"></A>Running <TT>lsmake</TT> as a Batch Job</H2>

<P><A NAME="7424"></A><TT>make</TT> jobs often require a lot of resources,
but no user interaction. Such jobs can be submitted to the LSF Batch system
so that they are processed when the needed resources are available. <TT>lsmake</TT>
includes extensions to run as a parallel batch job under LSF Batch:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="7499"></A>% <B>bsub -n 10 lsmake</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="7547"></A>This command queues an <TT>lsmake</TT> job that needs
10 hosts. When all 10 hosts are available, LSF Batch starts <TT>lsmake</TT>
on the first host, and passes the names of all hosts in an environment
variable. <TT>lsmake</TT> gets the host names from the environment variable
and uses the RES to run tasks.</P>

<P><A NAME="12215"></A>You can also specify a minimum and maximum number
of processors to dedicate to your <TT>make</TT> job (see <A HREF="06-submitting.html#26818">'Minimum
and Maximum Number of Processors'</A>):</P>

<PRE><A NAME="12220"></A>% <B>bsub -n 6,18 lsmake</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="7638"></A>Because <TT>lsmake</TT> passes the suspend signal
(<TT>SIGTSTP</TT>) to all its remote processes, the entire parallel <TT>make</TT>
job can be suspended and resumed by the user or the LSF Batch system.</P>

<H2><A NAME="7396"></A>Differences from Other Versions of make</H2>

<P><A NAME="2959"></A><TT>lsmake</TT> is fully compatible with GNU <TT>make</TT>.
There are some incompatibilities between GNU <TT>make</TT> and some other
versions of <TT>make</TT>; these are beyond the scope of this document.</P>

<P><A NAME="7741"></A>When <TT>lsmake</TT> is running processes on more
than one host, it does not send standard input to the remote processes.
Most makefiles do not require any user interaction through standard I/O.
If you have makefile steps that require user interaction, you can put the
commands that require interaction into your local task list. Commands in
the local task list always run on the local host, where they can read from
standard input and write to standard output.</P>
