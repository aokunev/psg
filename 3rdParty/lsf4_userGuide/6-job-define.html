<H1><A NAME="1000424"></A>Chapter 6. <A NAME="997895"></A>Defining Jobs</H1>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P><A NAME="1001803"></A>A job is an operation that a user asks JobScheduler
to automatically perform within the cluster when certain conditions are
met. The operation can be the execution of a shell script, or a command
line.</P>

<P><A NAME="1021677"></A>A job can be a one-time job, which is run only
once and then leaves the system forever, or a repetitive job, which is
run whenever the conditions are met. Jobs can have many attributes that
determine their behaviour and requirements.</P>

<P><A NAME="1021712"></A>After a job is submitted, it is placed into a
job queue waiting for scheduling by JobScheduler. The job will be automatically
started by JobScheduler on a suitable machine in the cluster once the specified
conditions are met. After the job has finished, the output from the job
is delivered to the user either into a specified file, or via e-mail.</P>

<P><A NAME="1021853"></A>Many jobs are repetitive jobs. A repetitive job
is featured by its dependency on a calendar. If the job is a repetitive
job, then the job is again put into the queue waiting for the next schedule
after it finishes one run.</P>

<P><A NAME="1021707"></A>This chapter defines some concepts about jobs
and their attributes, and describes the steps involved in submitting jobs
with different attributes.</P>

<H2><A NAME="1019876"></A>Job Attributes</H2>

<H3><A NAME="1020051"></A>JobID and JobName</H3>

<P><A NAME="1021729"></A>Every job in the JobScheduler is automatically
assigned a <I>jobID</I> that uniquely identifies the job. A <I>jobID</I>
is a positive integer that is returned by the JobScheduler when submitting
a job. </P>

<P><A NAME="1019877"></A>You can also assign a <I>jobName</I> to your job
for easy reference. It is used to identify a job for manipulation purposes,
such as job dependencies and job grouping. This name does not have to be
unique. Completely different jobs can be assigned the same name. If you
do not supply a name, the system uses the name of the submitted command
as the <I>jobName</I>. </P>

<H3><A NAME="1019991"></A>Dependency Condition</H3>

<P><A NAME="1020017"></A>Dependency condition is a job attribute you can
specify so that your job gets started when certain events happen. Your
job starts to run only if its dependency condition is <TT>TRUE</TT>. </P>

<P><A NAME="1021756"></A>The dependency condition is specified by a logical
expression of event status as described in <A HREF="4-events.html#1019490">'Events'</A>.
The minimum expression is <I>jobID</I> or <I>jobName</I>, which is equivalent
to <TT>done(jobID|jobName)</TT> (see <A HREF="6-job-define.html#1006504">'Inter-job Dependencies'</A>).
An expression can consist of one or more of the reserved keywords, identifiers,
and logic operators.</P>

<H4><A NAME="1019993"></A>Keywords</H4>

<P><A NAME="1019994"></A>You can select from seven reserved keywords: <TT>calendar</TT>,
<TT>started</TT>, <TT>done</TT>, <TT>exit</TT>, <TT>ended</TT>, <TT>file</TT>,
and <TT>event</TT>. </P>

<UL>
<LI><A NAME="1019995"></A>To depend on a calendar, use the <TT>calendar</TT>
condition. A job that is dependent on a calendar is a repetitive job </LI>

<LI><A NAME="1019996"></A>To depend on a previous job that has started
running or has already finished, use the <TT>started</TT> condition </LI>

<LI><A NAME="1019997"></A>To depend on a previous job that has finished
successfully in the <TT><A HREF="7-job-manage.html#1019666">DONE</A></TT>
state, use the <TT>done</TT> condition </LI>

<LI><A NAME="1019998"></A>To depend on a previous job that has finished
in the <TT><A HREF="7-job-manage.html#1019667">EXIT</A></TT> state, use
the <TT>exit</TT> condition </LI>

<LI><A NAME="1019999"></A>To depend on a previous job that has finished,
use the <TT>ended</TT> condition </LI>

<LI><A NAME="1020000"></A>To depend on a change in the file system, use
the <TT>file</TT> condition. There are four file event functions defined:
<TT>age</TT>, <TT>arrival</TT>, <TT>exist</TT>, and <TT>size</TT>, as described
in <A HREF="4-events.html#1020203">'File Events'</A> </LI>

<LI><A NAME="1020001"></A>To depend on user event, use the <TT>event</TT>
condition </LI>
</UL>

<H4><A NAME="1020002"></A>Logic Operators</H4>

<P><A NAME="1020003"></A>To create a more flexible dependency condition,
you can use the logical operators '<TT>&amp;&amp;</TT>' (AND), '<TT>||</TT>'
(OR), '<TT>!</TT>' (NOT) and parentheses '<TT>()</TT>'.</P>

<H3><A NAME="1019886"></A>Resource Requirements</H3>

<P><A NAME="1021774"></A>You can also specify resource requirements for
your job. Resource requirements specify the required resources before the
job can be scheduled to run on a host. This is useful especially when your
cluster consists of machines with different architectures, operating systems,
or hardware/software resources. </P>

<P><A NAME="1022233"></A>By specifying resource requirements, your job
is guaranteed to run on a host with the desirable resources. For example,
if your job must run on a host with the Solaris operating system, you can
specify such a requirement so that JobScheduler will make sure that only
Solaris machines are considered as candidate hosts for the job.</P>

<P><A NAME="1021798"></A>For more details about resource requirements,
see <A HREF="8-advanced.html#1020091">'Resource Requirements'</A>.</P>

<H3><A NAME="1021799"></A>Job Status</H3>

<P><A NAME="1019890"></A>After a job is submitted to JobScheduler, it goes
through a series of state transitions until it completes. The possible
states of a job during its life cycle are shown in <A HREF="6-job-define.html#1019901">Figure
22</A>.</P>

<H4><A NAME="1019901"></A>Figure 22. Job States </H4>

<P><A HREF="pjs-figure22.gif"><IMG SRC="pjs-figure22.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=160 WIDTH=368></A>
</P>

<P><A NAME="1006682"></A>Most JobScheduler jobs progress through only two
states:</P>

<UL>
<LI><A NAME="1005444"></A><TT><A HREF="7-job-manage.html#1019658">PEND</A></TT>:
waiting in the queue. </LI>

<LI><A NAME="1005446"></A><TT><A HREF="7-job-manage.html#1019659">RUN</A></TT>:
dispatched to a host and running. </LI>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="1021805"></A>A job remains pending until all conditions for
its execution are met. The conditions include dependency conditions, resource
requirements, and JobScheduler policies. The dependency conditions and
resource requirements are defined when you submit the job. The scheduling
policies are configured by your cluster administrator. </P>

<P><A NAME="1021824"></A>The run of a job may terminate abnormally for
various reasons. Termination may happen from any state. An abnormally terminated
job returns to <TT><A HREF="7-job-manage.html#1019658">PEND</A></TT> status
and is rescheduled. A job may terminate abnormally for a number of reasons.
</P>

<P><A NAME="1022838"></A>Repetitive jobs go back to <TT><A HREF="7-job-manage.html#1019658">PEND</A></TT>
status after they finish, waiting to be scheduled for future runs. A repetitive
job continues to go through the states of <TT><A HREF="7-job-manage.html#1019659">RUN</A></TT>
and <TT><A HREF="7-job-manage.html#1019658">PEND</A></TT> until it is removed
from the system with the <TT>bdel</TT> command.</P>

<P><A NAME="1021844"></A>Jobs may also be suspended at any time. A job
can be suspended by its owner, by the cluster administrator, or by the
JobScheduler. There are three different states for suspended jobs: <TT><A HREF="7-job-manage.html#1019660">PSUSP</A></TT>,
<TT><A HREF="7-job-manage.html#1019661">USUSP</A></TT>, and <TT><A HREF="7-job-manage.html#1019665">SSUSP</A></TT>.
The queue policy is the most important factor determining whether the system
will suspend your job.</P>

<H2><A NAME="1020998"></A>Submitting a Simple Job</H2>

<P><A NAME="1020999"></A>You use the <TT>bsub</TT> command to submit a
job to the system. The <TT>bsub</TT> command is a very complex program
with many optional arguments. Some of the more important ones allow you
to specify the input and output files used by your job, the hosts the job
will run on, and the queue the job will run from.</P>

<P><A NAME="1021302"></A>Each job has a name, a job ID, and a command to
execute.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1021141"></A>bsub [options] [-J <I>job_name</I>] [command [argument ...]]</PRE>

<P><A NAME="1021042"></A>The <I>job_name</I> is a string of text declared
with the <TT>-J</TT> option. If the string contains blanks or special characters,
it should be placed within quotes as well. When you submit the job to the
system, a jobID is assigned and displayed. If you do not supply a name,
the system uses a portion of the command name as the default job name.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1021566"></A>% <B>bsub -J JobSubmit find ~ -name core -atime +7 -exec rm {} \;
</B>Job &lt;7491&gt; is submitted to default queue &lt;default&gt;.</PRE>

<P><A NAME="1021852"></A>Since this job is not associated with a calendar
condition, it is a simple one-time job. To define a repetitive job, associate
it with a calendar, or make it depend on another repetitive job.</P>

<H3><A NAME="1021521"></A>Using <TT>xbsub</TT> to Submit a Job</H3>

<P><A NAME="1021522"></A>You can also submit your job using the GUI application
<TT>xbsub</TT> as shown in <A HREF="6-job-define.html#1021542">Figure 23</A>.</P>

<H4><A NAME="1021542"></A>Figure 23. <TT>xbsub</TT> Job Submission Window
</H4>

<P><A HREF="pjs-figure23.gif"><IMG SRC="pjs-figure23.gif" ALT="xbsub Job Submission Window" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=344 WIDTH=351></A>
</P>

<H3><A NAME="1021523"></A>Queue Selection</H3>

<P><A NAME="1021525"></A>When more than one queue is available, you need
to decide which queue to use. If you submit a job without specifying a
queue name, JobScheduler chooses a suitable queue as the default queue.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="1021056"></A>Specifying default queues</H4>

<P><A NAME="1021057"></A>Use the <TT>bparams</TT> command to display the
default queue: </P>

<PRE><A NAME="1021869"></A>% <B>bparams
</B>Default Queues: normal
Job Dispatch Interval:  20 seconds
Job Checking Interval: 80 seconds
Job Accepting Interval:  20 seconds</PRE>

<P><A NAME="1021873"></A>This command displays JobScheduler parameters
configured by your cluster administrator</P>

<P><A NAME="1021060"></A>You can override the default by defining the environment
variable <TT>LSB_DEFAULTQUEUE</TT>.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1021353"></A>% <B>setenv LSB_DEFAULTQUEUE priority</B></PRE>

<H4><A NAME="1021084"></A>Choosing a Queue</H4>

<P><A NAME="1021085"></A>The default queue is normally suitable to run
most jobs for the user. If you want to submit jobs to queues other than
the default queue, you should choose the most suitable queue for each job.</P>

<P><A NAME="1021086"></A>It is important that you choose the correct queue
for your job. The factors affecting your decision are user access restrictions,
size of the job, resource limits of the queue, scheduling priority of the
queue, active time windows of the queue, hosts used by the queue, the scheduling
load conditions, and the queue description. Use the <TT>bqueues</TT> command
with the <TT>-l</TT> option to get this information. </P>

<P><A NAME="1021088"></A>The <TT>-u <I>user_name</I></TT> option specifies
a user or user group so that the <TT>bqueues</TT> command displays only
the queues that accept jobs from these users.</P>

<P><A NAME="1021089"></A>The <TT>-m <I>host_name</I></TT> option allows
you to specify a host name or host group name so that the <TT>bqueues</TT>
command displays only the queues that use these hosts to run jobs.</P>

<P><A NAME="1021090"></A>You must also be sure that the queue is enabled.
See <A HREF="5-environment.html#1022596">'Viewing the JobScheduler Queues'</A>
for more information about <TT>bqueues</TT> command.</P>

<P><A NAME="1021094"></A>The following examples are based on the queues
defined in the default configuration. Your JobScheduler administrators
may have configured different queues.</P>

<UL>
<LI><A NAME="1021098"></A>To run a job during off hours, you can submit
it to the night queue. </LI>

<PRE><A NAME="1021099"></A>% <B>bsub -q night -J NightWork command</B></PRE>

<LI><A NAME="1021100"></A>If you have an urgent job to run, you can submit
it to the priority queue. </LI>

<PRE><A NAME="1021101"></A>% <B>bsub -q priority -J ImportantJob command</B></PRE>

<LI><A NAME="1021103"></A>If you are running small jobs and do not want
to wait too long to get the results, you can submit jobs to the short queue.
These jobs are dispatched with higher priority. Make sure your jobs are
short enough that they are not killed for exceeding the CPU time limit
of the queue (check the resource limits of the queue, if any). </LI>

<PRE><A NAME="1021380"></A>% <B>bsub -q short -J QuickJob command</B></PRE>
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="1021319"></A>Host Selection</H3>

<P><A NAME="1021321"></A>If you want to restrict the set of candidate hosts
for running your production job, use the <TT>-m</TT> option to the <TT>bsub</TT>
command.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1021322"></A>% <B>bsub -q idle -m &quot;hostA hostD hostC&quot; -J hostSelect command</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1021326"></A>This command submits your job to the idle queue
and tells JobScheduler to choose one host from <I>hostA</I>, <I>hostD</I>,
and <I>hostC</I> to run the job. All other scheduling conditions still
apply---the selected host must be eligible to run the job. </P>

<P><A NAME="1022671"></A>You can also specify your preference of hosts:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1022672"></A>% <B>bsub -q night -m &quot;hostA hostB+1 hostC+2&quot; -J prefHostJob command</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1022673"></A>This tells JobScheduler that the job should be
run <I>hostC</I> if it satisfies the requirements, otherwise run it on
<I>hostB</I>. <I>hostA</I> should be used only if neither <I>hostC</I>
or <I>hostB</I> can run the job. </P>

<H3><A NAME="1021104"></A>Input and Output</H3>

<P><A NAME="1021106"></A>When one of your jobs completes or exits, the
system by default sends you a job report together with the job's standard
output (<TT>stdout</TT>) and error output (<TT>stderr</TT>) by electronic
mail. The output from <TT>stdout</TT> and <TT>stderr</TT> are merged together
in the order they were printed, as if the job was run interactively. </P>

<P><A NAME="1021108"></A>If you want mail sent to another e-mail address,
specify the <TT>-u <I>username</I></TT> option to the <TT>bsub</TT> command.
Mail associated with the job will be sent to the named user instead of
to you.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1021391"></A>% <B>bsub -u user4 -J OtherUser command</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1021109"></A>If you do not want output to be sent by mail,
you can specify <TT>stdout</TT> and <TT>stderr</TT> files. You can also
specify the standard input file if the job needs to read input from <TT>stdin</TT>.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1021110"></A>% <B>bsub -q night -i job_in -o job_out -e job_err -J FileJob command</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1021111"></A>In the example, you submit your job to the night
queue. The job reads its input from file <I>job_in</I>. Standard output
is stored in file <I>job_out</I>, and standard error is stored in file
<I>job_err</I>. If you specify the <TT>-o <I>outfile</I></TT> argument
and do not specify the <TT>-e <I>errfile</I></TT> argument, the standard
output and error are merged and stored in <I>outfile</I>.</P>

<P><A NAME="1021112"></A>The output file created by the <TT>-o</TT> option
normally contains job report information as well as the job output. This
information includes the submitting user and host, the execution host,
the CPU time used by the job, and the exit status. If you want to separate
the job report information from the job output, use the <TT>-N</TT> option
to specify that the job report information should be sent by email.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1021397"></A>% <B>bsub -N -o job_out -e job_err -J EmailReport command</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1021113"></A>The output files specified by the <TT>-o</TT>
and <TT>-e</TT> options are created on the execution host.</P>

<H2><A NAME="1000466"></A>Submitting a Job with Dependencies</H2>

<P><A NAME="1004624"></A>Many jobs in a production environment are operations
in response to various events. Thus the scheduling of such jobs are dependent
on specific events happening.</P>

<P><A NAME="1021940"></A>Use the <TT>bsub</TT> command with the <TT>-w</TT>
option to submit a job with dependencies to the system.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1006492"></A>bsub [-w depend_cond] [command [argument ...]]</PRE>

<P><A NAME="1019832"></A>The dependency condition is specified with the
<TT>-w</TT> option followed by one of the reserved keywords, an identifier,
and logic operators. To prevent the shell from interpreting parentheses
or any blank or special characters, the keyword, identifier, and any logical
operators should be placed within quotes.</P>

<H3><A NAME="1020088"></A>Calendar Dependencies</H3>

<H4><A NAME="1020089"></A>Associating a Job with a User Calendar</H4>

<P><A NAME="1004475"></A>You submit a calendar-driven job using the <TT>bsub</TT>
command. The <TT>-w</TT> option is used with the calendar keyword to specify
a calendar dependent job.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1000651"></A>% <B>bsub -w &quot;calendar(calName)&quot; -J jobName &lt;command&gt;</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1004492"></A>To view the calendars on the system, use the <TT>bcal</TT>

<PRE><A NAME="1000654"></A>% <B>bsub -w &quot;calendar(*:*:*:23:30)&quot; cheque_run</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1020991"></A>An anonymous calendar is local to the job. It
is created when the job is submitted and is removed when the job is removed
from the system. It cannot be used by other jobs.</P>

<H3><A NAME="1006504"></A>Inter-job Dependencies</H3>

<P><A NAME="1019646"></A>Some of your jobs depend on the results of other
jobs. For example, a series of jobs could process time sheet data, calculate
earnings and taxes, update the payroll and tax ledgers, and finally print
the cheque run. Most steps can only be performed after the previous step
completes.</P>

<P><A NAME="1019944"></A>The prior jobs are identified by the <I>jobID</I>
number or a job name. The <I>jobID</I> is assigned and displayed by the
<TT>bsub</TT> command when the job is submitted. The job name is a string
specified by the <TT>-J <I>jobName</I></TT> option. If you did not supply
a name, the system uses the last 60 characters of the submitted command
as the job name.</P>

<P><A NAME="1020218"></A>While <I>jobID</I> may be used to specify the
jobs of any user, the job name can only be used to specify your own jobs.
If you submitted more than one job with the same job name, the last submitted
job is assumed.</P>

<P><A NAME="1019947"></A>A wildcard character '<TT>*</TT>' can be specified
at the end of a job name to indicate all jobs matching the name. For example,
<I>jobA*</I> will match <I>jobA</I>, <I>jobA1</I>, <I>jobA_test</I>, <I>jobA.log</I>,
etc. There must be at least one match. If more than one job matches, it
means your job depends on every one of the jobs.</P>

<P><A NAME="1020283"></A>There are four prior job dependency conditions:
<TT>started</TT>, <TT>done</TT>, <TT>exit</TT>, and <TT>ended</TT>. See
<A HREF="4-events.html#1020641">'Prior Job Events'</A> for the definition
of these events.</P>

<P><A NAME="1019953"></A>Specifying only <I>jobID</I> or <I>jobName</I>
is equivalent to <TT>done(jobID|jobName)</TT>.</P>

<P><A NAME="1020308"></A>A numeric job name should be doubly quoted, for
example <TT>-w &quot;'210'&quot;,</TT> since most UNIX shells treat <TT>-w
&quot;210&quot;</TT> the same as <TT>-w 210</TT>.</P>

<P><A NAME="1019954"></A>If any one of the conditional jobs is not found,
the <TT>bsub</TT> command fails and the job is not submitted.</P>

<P><A NAME="1005039"></A>If your job only requires that the prior job has
started processing (and it does not matter if it has completed), use the
<TT>started</TT> keyword.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1005105"></A>% <B>bsub -w &quot;started(first_job)&quot; -J second_job time_card</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1005079"></A>If your job requires that the prior job finished
successfully, use the keyword <TT>done</TT>.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1005094"></A>% <B>bsub -w &quot;done(pre_process)&quot; -J main_process cheque_run</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1005081"></A>If your job depends on the prior job failing (for
example, it is responsible for error recovery should the prior job terminate
abnormally), use the keyword <TT>exit</TT>.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1005115"></A>% <B>bsub -w &quot;exit(main_process)&quot; -J error_recovery re_run</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1005083"></A>When your job only requires that the prior job
has finished, regardless of the success or failure (for example, the prior
task may end successfully, but with a non-zero exit code), use the keyword
<TT>ended</TT>.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4><A NAME="1020360"></A>Other Examples</H4>

<P><A NAME="1020355"></A>The most simple inter-job dependency condition
is a <I>jobID</I> or a job name.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1020365"></A>% <B>bsub -w 8195 jobB</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1020397"></A>Your job may depend on a number of previous jobs.
In the example following, the submitted job, dependent, will not start
until job <I>312</I> has completed successfully, and either the job named
<I>Job2</I> has started or the job named <I>Job3</I> has terminated abnormally.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1020356"></A>&amp; <B>bsub -w &quot;done(312) &amp;&amp; (started(Job2) || exit(Job3))&quot; -J dependent command</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1020407"></A>The following submitted job will not start until
either job <I>1532</I> has completed, the job named <I>jobName2</I> has
completed, or all jobs with names beginning with <I>jobName3</I> have finished.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1020358"></A>% <B>bsub -w &quot;1532 || jobName2 || ended(jobName3*)&quot; -J NumberDepend command</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1021974"></A>You can also use a combination of calendar dependency
conditions and prior job dependency conditions:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1021975"></A>% <B>bsub -w &quot;done(1234) || calendar(weekly)&quot; backup_job</B></PRE>

<H3><A NAME="1006112"></A>Pre-execution Commands</H3>

<P><A NAME="1020410"></A>Some jobs require resources that JobScheduler
does not directly support. For example, a job may need to reserve a tape
drive or check for the availability of a software license.</P>

<P><A NAME="1020490"></A>Along with the dependency conditions associated
with prior jobs, bsub can also run pre-execution commands. You use the
<TT>-E</TT> option to specify an arbitrary command to run before starting
the main job. The pre-execution command is executed on the same host as
the main job. If the pre-execution command runs successfully, the main
job is started.</P>

<P><A NAME="1020492"></A>The standard input, output and error files for
the pre-execution command are opened to the same files as the job. Standard
input and output from the pre-execution command cannot be redirected. </P>

<P><A NAME="1020414"></A>The pre-execution command is run under the same
user ID, environment, and home and working directories as the main job.
If the pre-execution command is not in your normal execution path, the
full path name of the command must be specified.</P>

<P><A NAME="1020416"></A>The pre-execution command returns information
to JobScheduler using its exit status. If the pre-execution command exits
with non-zero status, the main job is not dispatched. The job goes back
to the <TT><A HREF="7-job-manage.html#1019658">PEND</A></TT> state and
is rescheduled later.</P>

<P><A NAME="1020418"></A>The following example shows a job that requires
a tape drive. The program <TT>tapecheck</TT> is a site specific program
that exits with status zero if the specified tape drive is ready, and status
one otherwise:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1020419"></A>% <B>bsub -E  &quot;/usr/local/bin/tapecheck /dev/rmt0l&quot; -w &quot;calendar(night)&quot; runTape</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1022507"></A>The JobScheduler system assumes the pre-execution
command can be run many times without having side effects. Therefore, you
should be careful not to reserve the same resource (for example, if the
pre-execution command reserves a software license) more than once for the
same job.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="1022511"></A><B>Note<BR>
</B><I>An alternative to using the </I><TT>-E</TT><I> option is for the
JobScheduler administrator to set up a queue level pre-execution command.

<H3><A NAME="1021937"></A>File Event Dependencies</H3>

<H4><A NAME="1021938"></A>Defining a Job Dependent on File Events</H4>

<P><A NAME="1019635"></A>You may want a job to run after some file event
has occurred. File events are submitted to the system using the <TT>file</TT>
keyword.</P>

<P><A NAME="1006221"></A>There are four file status functions defined:
<TT>age</TT>, <TT>arrival</TT>, <TT>exist</TT>, and <TT>size</TT>. The
definitions of these functions are described in <A HREF="4-events.html#1020203">'File
Events'</A>.</P>

<P><A NAME="1022004"></A>The <TT>age()</TT> function is typically used
together with relational operators to form a logical expression which evaluates
to either TRUE or FALSE:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1006450"></A>% <B>bsub -w &quot;file(age(/u/db/datafile) &gt; 4H)&quot; command</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1022011"></A>This creates a job that runs when file <TT>/u/db/datafile</TT>
is more than four hours old. Note that <TT>H</TT> here means hour. Other
characters that you can use to represent a time duration include <TT>D</TT>
(day) and <TT>W</TT> (week). The default is minute.</P>

<P><A NAME="1021994"></A>If you intend to trigger the job execution by
the creation of a file, use the <TT>arrival()</TT> function. This function
detects the transition of the specified file from non-existence to existence.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1021995"></A>% <B>bsub -w &quot;file(arrival(/usr/data/newfile))&quot; -R &quot;type==hppa&quot; command</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1022034"></A>This creates a job that runs when file <TT>newfile</TT>
is detected in <TT>/usr/data</TT> directory. Also note that a resource
requirement is specified so that this command should only be run on an
<I>hppa</I> host.</P>

<P><A NAME="1022035"></A>Unlike the <TT>age()</TT> function, the <TT>arrival()</TT>
function does not need a relational operator because the function evaluates
to either TRUE or FALSE.</P>

<P><A NAME="1006443"></A>If you are only interested in the existence of
the file instead of the transition of the creation, you can use the <TT>exist()</TT>
function.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1022160"></A>% <B>bsub -w &quot;file(!exist(/usr/data/lock_file))&quot; command</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1006434"></A>Use the function <TT>size()</TT> if you want to
run a job when the size of the file becomes a certain value.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1007038"></A>% <B>bsub -w &quot;file(size(/var/adm/logs/log_file) &gt;= 3.5 M)&quot; command</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1022068"></A>The character <TT>M</TT> refers to megabytes.
You could also use <TT>K</TT> to refer to kilobytes. The default is bytes.
Like the <TT>age()</TT> function, the <TT>size()</TT> function also requires
a relational operator to form a logical expression that evaluates to either
TRUE or FALSE.</P>

<P><A NAME="1021413"></A>The file event you are depending on may be on
another host. </P>

<PRE><A NAME="1021414"></A>% <B>bsub -w &quot;file(exist(hostD:/usr/local/fileA))&quot; command</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1007039"></A>You can submit a combination of functions. The
evaluation of the statement depends on the operators you use. In the following
statement, the command will be run if either <I>fileA</I> exists or <I>fileB</I>

<PRE><A NAME="1006150"></A>% <B>bsub -w &quot;file(exist(/usr/data/fileA) || arrival(/usr/data/fileB))&quot; command</B></PRE>

<H4><A NAME="1006036"></A>Creating a Job Dependent on User Events</H4>

<P><A NAME="1006838"></A>User events are created to the system when submitting
a job using the <TT>event</TT> keyword. For example, you want to define
a user event to detect the status of a tape device before a backup job

otherwise it is always FALSE. You can submit the following command:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1006466"></A>% <B>bsub -w &quot;event(tape_ready)&quot; BackUp</B></PRE>

<P><A NAME="1006467"></A>A user event, <TT>tape_ready</TT>, is created
by the system. The string <TT>&quot;tape_ready&quot;</TT> is then passed

If the event specified by the user contains anything that the <TT>eeventd</TT>
