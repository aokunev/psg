<H1><A NAME="1019601"></A>Chapter 3. <A NAME="1019490"></A>Events</H1>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P><A NAME="1019618"></A>Events drive jobs in a JobScheduler cluster. This
chapter presents the concepts and terms of events in JobScheduler. </P>

<P><A NAME="1020018"></A>JobScheduler responds to four kinds of events:</P>

<UL>
<LI><A NAME="1020053"></A>Time events are points of time that can be used
to trigger the scheduling of jobs. Time events are defined by calendars.
See <A HREF="3-calendars.html#1006181">'Calendars'</A> for detailed
descriptions about calendars. </LI>

<LI><A NAME="1020056"></A>Prior job events are the starting and completion
of other jobs. See <A HREF="6-job-define.html#1006504">'Inter-job Dependencies'</A>
for more detail. </LI>

<LI><A NAME="1019621"></A>File events are changes in the files residing
in accessible file systems, such as the arrival (creation) of a specific
file. </LI>

<LI><A NAME="1019625"></A>User events are site specific occurrences such
as a tape mount defined by the JobScheduler administrators for your system.
</LI>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="1019682"></A>File events and user events are handled by an
Event Server (<TT>eeventd</TT>)<SUP><A HREF="4-events.html#1019717">1.</A></SUP>. The
JobScheduler comes with an <TT>eeventd</TT> that handles file events. A
site can modify the <TT>eeventd</TT> to monitor any other site specific
events and use them to drive jobs.</P>

<P><A NAME="1020068"></A>Since file events and user events are events external
to the JobScheduler, they are also referred to as <I>external events</I>,
whereas time events and job events are referred to as <I>built-in events</I>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="1019507"></A>Event Status</H2>

<P><A NAME="1019510"></A>The <I>status</I> of an event has three possible
values:</P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="1019511"></A>active </DT>

<DD>The event is considered to have occurred. The dependency condition
for jobs waiting on the event will evaluate to TRUE. </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="1019512"></A>inactive </DT>

<DD>The event is considered to have not occurred. The dependency condition
for jobs waiting on the event is considered FALSE. </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="1019654"></A>invalid </DT>

<DD>This applies to external events only. The event is invalid and thus
is ignored by the Event Server. This usually occurs due to a syntax error
in the event statement. The dependency condition for jobs waiting on the
event will evaluate to FALSE. </DD>
</DL>

<P><A NAME="1019516"></A>At any moment, the event is either active, inactive,
or invalid.</P>

<H2><A NAME="1020080"></A>Built-in Events</H2>

<H3><A NAME="1019729"></A>Time Events</H3>

<P><A NAME="1019831"></A>Time events are generated according to calendars.
A calendar consists of one or more time expressions that define a sequence
of time events. Each time event is featured by a starting time and a duration
in which the event status is active. A calendar is said to be active if
one or more of the time events produced by the calendar is active.</P>

<P><A NAME="1020211"></A>Calendars are JobScheduler entities that can be
created, modified, and deleted. A calendar has an owner and a name. The
calendar owner is the user who created it. Only the owner can modify or
delete the calendar. The JobScheduler cluster administrators can create
system calendars. The owner of a system calendar is the virtual user SYS.
A user can use his/her own calendars, and system calendars, as well as
other users' calendars to trigger his/her job scheduling.</P>

<P><A NAME="1020208"></A>See <A HREF="3-calendars.html#1006181">'Calendars'</A>
for further details about time events and calendars.</P>

<H3><A NAME="1020641"></A>Prior Job Events</H3>

<P><A NAME="1020642"></A>In a production system, the status changes of
some jobs can trigger the scheduling of other jobs. The event that the
status of a job has changed is a job event. JobScheduler allows you to
submit a job so that the scheduling of this job is dependent on the status
of some prior job(s).</P>

<P><A NAME="1020136"></A>Unlike time events, you do not need to define
job events before you refer to them to specify an inter-job dependency.
Four job event functions are provided to specify an inter-job dependency
when you submit a job:</P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="1019732"></A><TT>started(job) </TT></DT>

<DD>The condition is TRUE if the specified job has started running or has
already finished. </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="1019733"></A><TT>done(job) </TT></DT>

<DD>The condition is TRUE if the specified job has finished successfully
in the DONE state. A job is considered to have finished successfully if
it terminates with exit code 0 (zero). </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="1019734"></A><TT>exit(job) </TT></DT>

<DD>The condition is TRUE if the specified job has terminated abnormally
in the EXIT state. A job is considered to have terminated abnormally if
it terminates with a non-zero exit code. </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="1020106"></A><TT>ended(job) </TT></DT>

<DD>The condition is TRUE if the specified job has finished. </DD>
</DL>

<P><A NAME="1020165"></A>The parameter <TT>job</TT> is either a jobID or
a jobname. See <A HREF="6-job-define.html#1006504">'Inter-job Dependencies'</A>
for examples of using the above functions when submitting a job.</P>

<H2><A NAME="1020108"></A>External Events</H2>

<P><A NAME="1020113"></A>External events allow your jobs to be triggered
by conditions external to JobScheduler. This provides a lot of flexibility
for you to integrate your site specific conditions with the scheduling
of your production jobs.</P>

<P><A NAME="1020226"></A>Typical examples of external events include the
arrival of a file, the mount of a device, the detection of an exception
situation in the system, etc.</P>

<P><A NAME="1020231"></A>External events are detected by the External Event
Daemon (<TT>eeventd</TT>), which resides on the same server host as the
master scheduler daemon (<TT>mbatchd</TT>). The <TT>eeventd</TT> communicates
with <TT>mbatchd</TT> using a well-defined protocol. The JobScheduler comes
with an <TT>eeventd</TT> that detects file events. A site can easily modify
the <TT>eeventd</TT> to integrate other events by adding event processing
functions.</P>

<H3><A NAME="1020203"></A>File Events</H3>

<P><A NAME="1019860"></A>A file event condition is specified as:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1020275"></A>file(file_condition_expression)</PRE>

<P><A NAME="1020276"></A>where the keyword <TT>file()</TT> tells the master
scheduler (<TT>mbatchd</TT>) that this is a file condition so that the
parameter <I>file_condition_expression</I> should be passed to the <TT>eeventd</TT>
for processing. The <I>file_condition_expression</I> is a logical expression
in terms of the following four file status functions:</P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="1020316"></A><TT>arrival(file_loc) </TT></DT>

<DD>This function evaluates to TRUE when file specified by <I>file_loc</I>
arrives. The arrival of a file refers to the transition from non-existence
to existence of the file. </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="1020317"></A><TT>exist(file_loc) </TT></DT>

<DD>This function evaluates to TRUE if the file specified by <I>file_loc</I>
exists. Note that this function is different from <TT>arrival()</TT> in
that a transition from a non-existence to existence is not needed. As long
as the file exists, the function always evaluates to TRUE. </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="1020330"></A><TT>size(file_loc) </TT></DT>

<DD>This function evaluates to the size of the file specified by <I>file_loc</I>
in bytes. If the file does not exist, this function evaluates to 0. </DD>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="1020335"></A><TT>age(file_loc) </TT></DT>

<DD>This function evaluates to the age of the file specified by <I>file_loc</I>
since the last modification in minutes. If the file does not exist, this
function evaluates to 0. </DD>
</DL>

<P><A NAME="1020243"></A><TT>Th</TT>e <TT>file_loc</TT> in the above functions
takes the following form:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1020327"></A>[hostname:]absolute_directory/filename</PRE>

<P><A NAME="1020329"></A>where <I>hostname</I> is the name of the host
on which the file can be accessed. Note that this host does not have to
be the same host on which the job executes. If <I>hostname</I> is not specified,
then the Event Server assumes that the file is accessible from any host.
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><A NAME="1020587"></A><B>Note<BR>
</B><I>You must specify the absolute path name of the file being evaluated
in the above expressions.</I></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A NAME="1020341"></A>An example of a file event condition using the
above file event functions is:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1020342"></A>file(exist(/tmp/core) &amp;&amp; size(/tmp/core)&gt;10M)</PRE>

<P><A NAME="1020340"></A>A file event is automatically created when a user
submits a job with a file event dependency condition. The event is automatically
removed when there are no dependent jobs.</P>

<P><A NAME="1020408"></A>See <A HREF="6-job-define.html#1021937">'File
Event Dependencies'</A> for examples of how to use file event conditions
when submitting a job.</P>

<H3><A NAME="1019842"></A>User Events</H3>

<P><A NAME="1019843"></A>JobScheduler provides an open mechanism for sites
to implement site specific events by adding more event processing functions
into the External Event Daemon (<TT>eeventd</TT>). A user event condition
is specified as:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1020387"></A>event(event_spec)</PRE>

<P><A NAME="1020719"></A>where the keyword <TT>event()</TT> tells the master
scheduler (<TT>mbatchd</TT>) that this is a user event so that the parameter
<I>event_spec</I> should be passed to <TT>eeventd</TT> for processing.
The site is responsible for writing the function that parses and processes
the <I>event_spec</I>. See <A HREF="08-jobscheduler.html#11265">'External
Event Management'</A> of the <I><A HREF="admin-title.html">LSF Administrator's
Guide</A></I> for details of how to modify <TT>eeventd</TT>.</P>

<P><A NAME="1020398"></A>A user event can be used to detect arbitrary site
specific environmental status that can trigger production jobs. For example,
a '<TT>diskisfull</TT>' event could be designed to detect the fact that
a critical file system is full, and therefore, an exception handling job
should be triggered to correct the situation. In this case, the user event
condition might be specified as:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1020405"></A>event(diskisfull)</PRE>

<P><A NAME="1020428"></A>This will create an event '<TT>diskisfull</TT>'
which is monitored by <TT>diskisfull</TT> event processing function in
the <TT>eeventd</TT>.</P>

<P><A NAME="1020454"></A>See <A HREF="6-job-define.html#1020582">'User
Event Dependencies'</A> for examples of associating user events with job
submissions.</P>

<H2><A NAME="1020460"></A>Viewing External Events</H2>

<P><A NAME="1020463"></A>You can view all the external events monitored
by <TT>eeventd</TT> using <TT>bevents</TT> command.</P>

<PRE><A NAME="1020464"></A>% <B>bevents
</B>EVENT               OWNER   STATUS   SOURCE    ATTRIBUTE      LAST_UPDATE
arrival(/data/file) user1   active    file       -       Oct 31 14:30:15 1996
size(/tmp/core)&gt;10M user1   inactive  file       -       Oct 31 14:30:15 1996
diskisfull          user2   inactive  user      /usr     Oct 22 11:23:02 1996</PRE>

<HR><SUP>1.<A NAME="1019717"></A></SUP> The administrators must install
and configure an Event Server that interacts between JobScheduler and the
site specific devices you need to monitor. For more details, see <A HREF="08-jobscheduler.html#11265">'External
