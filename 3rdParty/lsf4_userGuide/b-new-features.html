<H1><A NAME="26636"></A>Appendix B. <A NAME="21664"></A>New Features in
LSF 3.0</H1>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P><A NAME="21667"></A>LSF version 3.0 includes many new features requested
by LSF users, as well as bug fixes to LSF version 2.2. Most of the new
features are enhancements to the LSF Batch system.</P>

<P><A NAME="26379"></A>This chapter summarizes the new features that are
related to LSF end users. The new features that concern LSF administration
are described in the <I><A HREF="admin-title.html">LSF Administrator's
Guide</A></I>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="29293"></A>Host Preference</H2>

<P><A NAME="29294"></A>When several hosts can satisfy the resource requirements
of a job the hosts are ordered by load. However in certain situations it
maybe desirable to override this behaviour to give preference to certain
hosts even if they are more heavily loaded. For example, your LSF cluster
may consist of a few dedicated batch servers and a few desktop machines.
A desktop machine can also run jobs when the console user is not using
it interactively. You prefer to run on the dedicated servers and only use
the desktop if no dedicated server is available.</P>

<P><A NAME="29326"></A>The -m option of <TT>bsub</TT> allows you to specify
preference by using '+' after the host name. A special hostname '<TT>others</TT>'
can be used to refer to other hosts not listed. You can also optionally
specify a preference level for each host for more flexible preference.</P>

<H2><A NAME="29356"></A>Interactive Batch Job Support</H2>

<P><A NAME="29358"></A>A batch job can be submitted in interactive mode
such that all input and output are through the terminal from which the
<TT>bsub</TT> command is issued. This enables the user to run interactive
jobs under the resource sharing control supported by LSF Batch. With this
support, all the jobs can be under the effective resource sharing control,
scheduling policies, and job accounting of LSF Batch.</P>

<P><A NAME="29371"></A>An interactive batch job is submitted by specifying
the <TT>-I</TT> option of the <TT>bsub</TT> command.</P>

<H2><A NAME="29376"></A>Shell Mode for Remote Execution</H2>

<P><A NAME="29378"></A>Shell mode support is provided for running interactive
applications through the RES or through LSF Batch. Shell mode support is
required to run interactive shells or applications which redefine the <B><FONT SIZE=-1>CNTL-C</FONT></B>&nbsp;and
<B><FONT SIZE=-1>CNTL-Z</FONT></B>&nbsp;keys (for example, <TT>jove</TT>).
The <TT>-S</TT> option to <TT>lsrun(1)</TT>, <TT>ch(1)</TT>, and <TT>lsgrun(1)</TT>
creates the remote task with shell mode support. The <TT>-Is</TT> option
to <TT>bsub(1)</TT> provides the same feature for interactive batch jobs.</P>

<H2><A NAME="29391"></A>Job Starter</H2>

<P><A NAME="29396"></A>Some jobs have to be started under particular shells
or require certain setup steps to be performed before the actual job is
executed. The Job Starter feature allows you to specify an executable which
will perform the actual execution of the job, doing any necessary setup
beforehand. For batch jobs, the job starter can be configured at the queue
level by LSF administrator. For non-batch jobs through the RES it can be
specified through an environment variable. This feature is particularly
useful for users who run jobs in an Atria ClearCase environment.</P>

<H2><A NAME="29411"></A>Resource Consumption Monitoring of Running Jobs</H2>

<P><A NAME="29420"></A>In previous versions, resource consumption of jobs
are only available when a job finishes. With LSF 3.0, it is now possible
to see the resource consumption of jobs while they are still running. Such
information is collected periodically by LSF Batch daemons and visible
by users using the <TT>bjobs</TT> command.</P>

<H2><A NAME="29424"></A>Job-Level Resource Limits</H2>

<P><A NAME="29426"></A>The <TT>CPULIMIT</TT> parameter is now enforced
at the job-level in addition to the process level. If a job starts multiple
processes periodically which do some work and terminate, the system will
accumulate the CPU time of previous processes in the job.</P>

<H2><A NAME="29414"></A>Resource Reservation</H2>

<P><A NAME="29437"></A>If you are concerned about other jobs be dispatched
to the same hosts on which your jobs are running, you can use the resource
reservation feature of LSF 3.0. Resources can be reserved as specified
by resource requirements. No other job will use the reserved resources
even if the job which reserved the resources has not consumed them. The
amounts of reserved resources can be viewed by users through LSF commands.
You can specify both the amount of reservation as well as a duration. </P>

<H2><A NAME="29413"></A>More Specific Job Pending Reasons</H2>

<P><A NAME="29447"></A>In previous versions, the job pending reasons printed
out by bjobs do not give very specific information about related hosts.
With 3.0, the related host names are printed out along with the job pending
reasons by the <TT>bjobs</TT> <TT>-p</TT> <TT>-l</TT> command. </P>

<H2><A NAME="29452"></A>Enhanced Parallel Job Support</H2>

<P><A NAME="29455"></A>The following enhancements have been made to more
effectively support parallel jobs running through LSF Batch. </P>

<UL>
<LI><A NAME="29463"></A>Range of processor requirement: The <TT>-n</TT>
option of <TT>bsub</TT> now takes a minimum and maximum number. </LI>

<LI><A NAME="29464"></A>Locality and dispersion: You can now specify that
your parallel job should be limited to run on processors within one host.
Or you can specify that the job should be distributed across host so that
only one program component is allocated per machine. </LI>

<LI><A NAME="29480"></A>Processor Reservation: The scheduling of parallel
jobs has been enhanced to support the notion of processor reservation.
Parallel jobs requiring a large number of processors often can not be started
if there are many lower priority sequential jobs in the system. There may
not be enough resources at any one instant to satisfy a large parallel
job, but there may be enough to allow a sequential job to be started. With
the processor reservation feature the problem of starvation of parallel
jobs can be reduced. LSF Batch reserves job slots dynamically for parallel
jobs to increase the chance of getting enough slots to run the job. Many
LSF Batch commands now also displays a new field '<TT>RSV</TT>' to refer
to slots that are reserved for parallel jobs or for jobs that preempt others.
</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="29496"></A>Enhanced Checkpointing Interface</H2>

<P><A NAME="29454"></A>LSF 3.0 provides a uniform checkpointing interface
to allow users to either use the default checkpointing mechanism, or to
integrate their own check-pointing method with LSF Batch. Checkpointing
is now accomplished by two external executables: <TT>echkpnt</TT> and <TT>erestart</TT>.
</P>

<P><A NAME="29506"></A>Users or LSF administrator can modify or rewrite
these executables to interface their own checkpointing facility with LSF
Batch. </P>

<H2><A NAME="29507"></A>Using Hostname in the Resource Requirement String</H2>

<P><A NAME="29509"></A>LSF now recognize a new keyword &quot;<TT>hname</TT>&quot;
in a resource requirement string. This allows more flexibility in host
selections. For example, you can use &quot;<TT>hname != hostA</TT>&quot;
to exclude the selection of <TT>hostA</TT>. </P>

<H2><A NAME="29510"></A>Customizing Menu Items of <TT>xlsbatch</TT></H2>

<P><A NAME="29512"></A><TT>xlsbatch</TT> is now customizable. You can customize
the menu items of <TT>xlsbatch</TT> by specifying &quot;<TT>customizedMenu</TT>&quot;
resource in the X resource file. With this feature, you can add/remove/modify
menu items in the pull-down menus. Each menu item can be associated with
an external executable. So you can define your own actions by changing
the menu items.</P>

<H2><A NAME="29516"></A>New Option for <TT>bjobs</TT> Command</H2>

<P><A NAME="29518"></A>The <TT>-r</TT> option has been added to the <TT>bjobs</TT>
command to display jobs in <TT>RUN</TT> status. </P>
