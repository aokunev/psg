<H1><A NAME="228"></A>Chapter 7. <A NAME="9953"></A>Managing LSF JobScheduler</H1>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P><A NAME="11374"></A>Production job scheduling has been an integral part
of mainframe data processing operation for decades. With the emergence
of distributed computing along with UNIX and Windows NT workstations and
file servers, the system architecture has changed drastically, calling
for a new approach to production job scheduling.</P>

<P><A NAME="11383"></A>LSF JobScheduler is a distributed production job
scheduling product; a separately licensed component of the LSF Version
3.0 suite. LSF JobScheduler integrates heterogeneous servers into a <I>virtual
mainframe</I> to deliver high availability, robustness and ease-of-use.
It provides the functions of traditional mainframe job scheduler with transparent
operation across a network of heterogeneous UNIX and NT systems. LSF JobScheduler
offers GUI input tools in addition to the standard command line interface.</P>

<P><A NAME="11252"></A>Most features that can be configured for LSF Batch
can also be configured for LSF JobScheduler. In addition, LSF JobScheduler
supports many features such as calendars, file status events, site defined
events, etc. See <I><A HREF="pjs-title.html">LSF JobScheduler User's Guide</A></I>
for full details of these features. </P>

<P><A NAME="11595"></A>The configuration and management tasks for LSF JobScheduler
is the same as those of LSF Batch, so you should read all previous chapters
to do the administration tasks. This chapter discusses some additional
tasks specific for LSF JobScheduler which include: </P>

<UL>
<LI><A NAME="11482"></A>System calendars </LI>

<LI><A NAME="11483"></A>External (site-specific) event management </LI>

<LI><A NAME="11484"></A>File event management </LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="11253"></A>System Calendars</H2>

<P><A NAME="11254"></A>Calendars are normally created by users using the
<TT>bcaladd</TT> command or the <TT>xbcal</TT> GUI interface. Calendars
that are commonly used may be defined as system calendars, which can be
referenced by all users. System calendars are defined in the <TT>lsb.calendars</TT>
configuration file in the <TT>LSB_CONFDIR/<I>cluster</I>/configdir</TT>
directory.</P>

<P><A NAME="11255"></A>The <TT>lsb.calendars</TT> file consists of multiple
<TT>Calendar</TT> sections where each section corresponds to one calendar.
Each calendar section requires the <TT>NAME</TT> and <TT>TIME_EVENTS</TT>
parameter and can optionally contain a <TT>DESCRIPTION</TT> parameter.
The <TT>Calendar</TT> section is of the form:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="11256"></A><TT>Begin Calendar
NAME=&lt;<I>name</I>&gt;
TIME_EVENTS=&lt;<I>time events</I>&gt;
DESCRIPTION=&lt;<I>description</I>&gt;
End Calendar </TT></PRE>

<P><A NAME="11257"></A>The syntax of the <TT>TIME_EVENTS</TT> parameter
is described in the man page <TT>bcaladd</TT>(<TT>1</TT>). Also see <A HREF="3-calendars.html#999254">'Time
Expression'</A> in the <I><A HREF="pjs-title.html">LSF JobScheduler User's
Guide</A></I>.</P>

<P><A NAME="11512"></A>The following is a sample <TT>lsb.calendars</TT>
file:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="11261"></A><TT>Begin Calendar
NAME=Daily
TIME_EVENTS=*:*:*:8,6:00
DESCRIPTION=Daily morning and evening runs
End Calendar

Begin Calendar
NAME=Holiday
TIME_EVENTS=*:Dec:25:00:00%1D *:Jan:1:00:00%1D *:Jul:4:00:00%1D
DESCRIPTION=Holidays
End Calendar</TT></PRE>

<P><A NAME="11262"></A>System calendars are owned by the virtual user <TT>SYS</TT>
and can be viewed by everybody. The <TT>bcal</TT> command displays the
system calendars:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="11456"></A>% <B>bcal
</B>CALENDAR_NAME      OWNER      STATUS    DURATION         NEXT_EVENT_TIME
Daily              SYS       inactive       -        Wed Dec 25 06:00:00 1996
Holiday            SYS       inactive       -        Wed Dec 25 00:00:00 1996
hourly             user1      active        7        Tue Dec 24 16:00:00 1996
complex            user1     inactive       -        Wed Dec 25 17:00:00 1996</PRE>

<P><A NAME="11494"></A>System calendars cannot be created with the <TT>bcaladd</TT>
command and they cannot be deleted with the <TT>bcaldel</TT> command. When
a system calendar is defined, its name becomes a reserved calendar name
in the cluster. Consequently, users cannot create a calendar with the same
name as a system calendar.</P>

<H2><A NAME="11265"></A>External Event Management</H2>

<P><A NAME="11269"></A>LSF JobScheduler supports the scheduling of jobs
based on external site-specific events. A typical use of this feature in
data processing environment is to trigger jobs based on the arrival of
data or the availability of tapes. Sites that use storage management systems,
for example, can coordinate the dispatch of jobs with the staging of data
from hierarchical storage onto disk. </P>

<P><A NAME="11270"></A>The scheduling daemon (<TT>mbatchd</TT>) can startup
and communicate with an external event daemon (<TT>EEVENTD</TT>) to detect
the occurrence of events. The <TT>EEVENTD</TT> is implemented as an executable
called <TT>eeventd</TT> which resides in <TT>LSF_SERVERDIR</TT>. Users
can submit jobs specifying dependencies on any logical combination of external
events using the <TT>-w</TT> option of the <TT>bsub</TT> command. External
event dependencies can be combined with job, file, and calendar events.</P>

<P><A NAME="11271"></A>A protocol is defined which allows <TT>mbatchd</TT>
to indicate to the <TT>EEVENTD</TT> that a job is waiting on a particular
event. The <TT>EEVENTD</TT> will monitor the event and possibly take actions
to trigger it. When the event occurs, the <TT>EEVENTD</TT> informs <TT>mbatchd</TT>,
which will then consider the job as eligible for dispatch provided appropriate
hosts are available.</P>

<P><A NAME="11619"></A>LSF JobScheduler comes with an <TT>EEVENTD</TT>
for file event detection. If you want to monitor additional site events,
you can simply add event detection functions into the existing <TT>EEVENTD</TT>.
The source code of the default <TT>EEVENTD</TT> is also included in the
release. </P>

<H3><A NAME="11272"></A>The <TT>EEVENTD</TT> Protocol</H3>

<P><A NAME="11273"></A>The protocol between the external event daemon,
<TT>EEVENTD</TT>, and <TT>mbatchd</TT> consists of a sequence of ASCII
messages that are exchanged over a socket pair. The startup sequence and
message format for the protocol is described in the man page <TT>eeventd</TT>(<TT>8</TT>).
</P>

<P><A NAME="11274"></A>Each event is identified by an <I>event name</I>.
The event name is an arbitrary string, which is site-specific. A user specifies
job dependencies on an external event by using the <TT>-w</TT> option of
the <TT>bsub</TT> command using the <TT>event</TT> keyword. For example:</P>

<PRE><A NAME="11275"></A><TT>% <B>bsub -w 'event(tapeXYZ)' myjob</B></TT></PRE>

<P><A NAME="11279"></A>LSF JobScheduler considers the job to be waiting
on an event with the name 'tapeXYZ'. There is no checking of the syntax
of the event name by LSF JobScheduler. The <TT>EEVENTD</TT> can reject
an event if the syntax is incorrect preventing the job from being dispatched
until the user either modifies the event or removes the job. Alternatively,
a site may write a wrapper submission script which checks the syntax of
the event before it is submitted to LSF JobScheduler.</P>

<P><A NAME="11286"></A>The following messages are sent from <TT>mbatchd</TT>
to the <TT>EEVENTD</TT>:</P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="11287"></A><TT>SUB event_name </TT></DT>

<DD>Subscribe to a the event given by <I>event_name</I>. Whenever a job
is submitted with a new event name that mbatchd has not seen before, a
subscribe request is sent to the <TT>EEVENTD</TT>. The <TT>EEVENTD</TT>
is expected to monitor the event, and if necessary, to take any actions
required for the event to occur. </DD>

<DT><A NAME="11288"></A><TT>UNSUB event_name </TT></DT>

<DD>Unsubscribe to a given event when there are no jobs dependent on this
event. This should cause the <TT>EEVENTD</TT> to stop monitoring the event.
</DD>
</DL>

<P><A NAME="11289"></A>The following messages are sent from the <TT>EEVENTD</TT>
to <TT>mbatchd</TT>:</P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="11290"></A><TT>START event_name event_type [event_attrib]
</TT></DT>

<DD>Tells <TT>mbatchd</TT> to make the event active. The <I>event_type</I>
field should be one of <TT>latched</TT>, <TT>pulse</TT>, <TT>pulseAll</TT>,
or <TT>exclusive</TT>. The different event types control when <TT>mbatchd</TT>
will inactivate an event as follows: </DD>

<DD><A NAME="11291"></A><TT>latched </TT></DD>

<DL>
<DD>Not automatically inactivated until an explicit <TT>END</TT> message
is received. </DD>
</DL>

<DD><A NAME="11292"></A><TT>pulse </TT></DD>

<DL>
<DD>Automatically inactivated when one job is dispatched. Subsequent <TT>START</TT>
messages on the same event can cause one job to be dispatched, each time
the event is pulsed. </DD>
</DL>

<DD><A NAME="11293"></A><TT>pulseAll </TT></DD>

<DL>
<DD>Automatically inactivated after it is received. For <TT>pulseAll</TT>
events, each job will maintain its own copy of the event state. When a
<TT>pulseAll</TT> event is triggered, all jobs currently waiting on the
event will have their copy of the event state marked as active and will
be eligible for dispatch. Subsequently submitted jobs will view the event
as inactive. </DD>
</DL>

<DD><A NAME="11294"></A><TT>exclusive </TT></DD>

<DL>
<DD>Automatically inactivated when one job is dispatched and kept inactive
until the job completes. Subsequent attempts by the <TT>EEVENTD</TT> to
activate the event are ignored until job completion. </DD>
</DL>

<DD><A NAME="11295"></A>The <I>event_attrib</I> is an optional attribute
string that can be associated with the event. The event attribute is not
interpreted by the system and is passed to a job when it starts via the
<TT>LSB_EVENT_ATTRIB</TT> environment variable. It can be used to communicate
information between the event daemon and the job. It is also displayed
by the <TT>bevents</TT> command. </DD>

<DT><A NAME="11296"></A><TT>END event_name </TT></DT>

<DL>
<DT>Causes the event to be put in the inactive state. If the event is already
inactive, this has no effect. </DT>
</DL>

<DT><A NAME="11297"></A><TT>REJECT event_name [event_attribute] </TT></DT>

<DD>Causes the event to be put in the reject state. This can be used to
indicate a syntax error in the event name. Rejected events are considered
to be inactive so that jobs waiting on them are not dispatched. The optional
<I>event_attrib</I> can be used to give more information about why the
job is rejected. This information will be displayed by the <TT>bevents</TT>
command. </DD>
</DL>

<P><A NAME="11306"></A>The sequence of interactions between <TT>mbatchd</TT>
and the <TT>EEVENTD</TT> are shown in <A HREF="08-jobscheduler.html#11307">Figure
12</A>.</P>

<H4><A NAME="11307"></A>Figure 12. <TT>mbatchd</TT> and <TT>EEVENTD</TT>
Interactions</H4>

<P><A HREF="adm-figure12.gif"><IMG SRC="adm-figure12.gif" ALT="mbatchd and EEVENTD Interactions" BORDER=0 HEIGHT=252 WIDTH=438></A></P>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="11308"></A><B>Step 1. </B></DT>

<DD>User submits a job specifying dependency on the external event <I>eventX</I>
</DD>

<DT><A NAME="11309"></A><B>Step 2. </B></DT>

<DD><TT>mbatchd</TT> scans event table to see if <I>eventX</I> already
exists. If not, it creates the event and sends a subscribe message to the
<TT>EEVENTD</TT>. The <TT>EEVENTD</TT> recognizes <I>eventX</I> and initiates
monitoring it. If the <TT>EEVENTD</TT> could not recognize <I>eventX</I>,
it returns a <TT>REJECT</TT> message to <TT>mbatchd</TT>. </DD>

<DT><A NAME="11311"></A><B>Step 3. </B></DT>

<DD>The <TT>EEVENTD</TT> detects an occurrence of <I>eventX</I> and sends
a <TT>START</TT> message telling <TT>mbatchd</TT> to try to schedule any
jobs waiting on the event. Since <I>eventX</I> is <TT>latched</TT>, <TT>mbatchd</TT>
will consider the event as active indefinitely. If a job also has a dependency
on a calendar, it can be run multiple times while <I>eventX</I> is still
active. </DD>

<DT><A NAME="11313"></A><B>Step 4. </B></DT>

<DD>The <TT>EEVENTD</TT> detects that <I>eventX</I> is no longer occurring
and sends an <TT>END</TT> message. <TT>mbatchd</TT> considers <I>eventX</I>
as inactive and stops scheduling jobs waiting on the event. </DD>
</DL>

<DD><A NAME="11320"></A><A HREF="08-jobscheduler.html#11311">Step 3</A>
and <A HREF="08-jobscheduler.html#11313">step 4</A> can be repeated multiple
times.</DD>

<DL>
<DT><A NAME="11321"></A><B>Step 5. </B></DT>

<DD>The user deletes the job waiting on <I>eventX</I>. </DD>

<DT><A NAME="11322"></A><B>Step 6. </B></DT>

<DD>If there are no jobs in the system waiting on <I>eventX</I>, an <TT>UNSUB</TT>
message is sent to the <TT>EEVENTD</TT>. This should cause the <TT>EEVENTD</TT>
to stop monitoring <I>eventX</I>. </DD>
</DL>

<P><A NAME="11323"></A>The external event daemon given in <TT>examples/eevent/eevent.c</TT>
provides an example of a simple event daemon. It receives requests from
<TT>mbatchd</TT> to subscribe and unsubscribe to events. Periodically,
it scans the list of subscribed events and toggles the state of the event
between active and inactive. The type of the event is chosen based on the
event name, that is event names beginning with the string '<TT>exclusive</TT>'
or '<TT>pulse</TT>' are treated as exclusive events or pulse events respectively.
Otherwise the event is treated as a latched event.</P>

<H2><A NAME="11324"></A>File Event Handling</H2>

<P><A NAME="11325"></A>The handling of file events is implemented using
the default external event daemon. The installation scripts automatically
install the event daemon that handles file events.</P>

<P><A NAME="11326"></A>Since only one external event daemon can run on
a system, sites requiring file event handling in addition to site-specific
events must modify the existing file event daemon. The source is provided
in <TT>examples/eevent/fevent.c</TT> in the distribution directory.</P>

<P><A NAME="11622"></A>You can monitor all external events using the <TT>bevents</TT>
command. See the <I><A HREF="pjs-title.html">LSF JobScheduler User's Guide</A></I>
for details. </P>
