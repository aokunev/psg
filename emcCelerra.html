<H1>EMC Celerra</H1>

<H3>EMC Celerra 101</H3>

Celerra is the NAS offering from EMC.


<PRE>

Control station is the management station where all admin commands are issued:

https://celerra-cs0.myco.com/ 	# web gui URL.  Most feature avail there, including a console.

ssh celerra-cs0.myco.com	# ssh (or rsh, telnet in) for CLI access


Layers:
  
VDM (vdm2) / DM (server_2)		
  |
Export/Share
  |
Mount
  |
File System
  |
(AVM stripe, volume, etc)
  |
storage pool (nas_pool)
  |
disk

Export can export subdirectory within a File System.
All FS are native Unix FS.  CIFS features are added thru Samba (and other EMC add ons?).

CIFS share recommended thru VDM, for easier migration, etc.  
NFS share thru normal DM (server_X).  Physical DM can mount/export FS already shared by VDM, 
but VDM can't access the "parent" export done by a DM.
VDM mounts are accessible by underlaying DM via /root_vdm_N

Quota can be on tree (directory), per user a/o group.



Commands are to be issued thru the "control station" (ssh) 
(or web gui (Celerra Manager) or Windows MMC SnapIn (Celerra Management).)

Most commands are the form:
server_...
nas_...
fs_...
/nas/sbin/...

typical options can be abreviated, albeit not listed in command usage:
-l = -list
-c = -create
-n = -name
-P = -Protocol


nas_halt	# orderly shutdown of the whole NS80 integrated.  
		# issue command from control station.

<H3>IMHO Admin Notes</H3>

Celerra sucks as it compares to the NetApp.
<B>If you have to manage one of these suckers, I am sorry for you </B>
(I am very sorry for myself too).
I am so ready to convert my NS-80 integrated into a CX380 and chuck all the Data Mover that create the NAS head.
There are lot of catchas.  More often than not, it will bite you in your ass.  Just be very careful,
and know that when you need to most to change some option, count on it needing a reboot!
The "I am sorry" quote came from a storage architect.  One of my former boss used to be a big advocate of EMC Celerra 
but after having to plan multiple outage to fix things (which NetApp wouldn't have to), he became a Celerra hater.

Comments apply to DART 5.5 and 5.6 (circa 2008, 2009)

<OL>
<LI>Windows files are stored as NFS, plus some hacking side addition for meta data.  <BR>
    This mean from the getgo, need to decide how to store the userid and gid.  UserMapper is a very different beast than the usermap.cfg used in NetApp.
<LI>Quota is nightmare.  Policy change is impossible.  Turning it off require removing all files on the path.
<LI>Web GUI is heavy Java, slow and clunky.  And if you have the wrong java on your laptop, well, good luck!
<LI>CLI is very unforgiven in specification of parameters and sequences.

<LI>The nas_pool command shows how much space is available, but give 
no hints of virtual provisioning limit (NetApp may have the same problem though)
</OL>

Some good stuff, but only marginally:
<OL>
<LI>CheckPoint is more powerful than NetApp's Snapshot, but it requires a bit more setup.  Arguably it does not hog up mainstream production file system space due to snapshot, and they can be deleted individually, so it is worth all the extra work it brings. :-)
<LI>
</OL>


<H3>Sample Setup</H3>

Below is a sample config for a brand new setup from scratch.  The general flow is:
<OL>
<LI>Setup network connectivity, EtherChannel, etc
<LI>Define Active/Standby server config
<LI>Define basic network servers such as DNS, NIS, NTP
<LI>Create Virtual CIFS server, join them to Windows Domain
<LI>Create a storage pool for use with AVM
<LI>Create file systems
<LI>Mount file systems on DM/VDM, export/share them
</OL>

</PRE>

See additional notes in Config Approach below.

<H3>Config Approach</H3>



<LI> Make decision whether to use USERMAPPER  (okay in CIFS only world, but if there is any UNIX, most likely NO).
<LI> Decide on Quotas policy 
<LI> Plan for Snapshots...
<LI> An IP address can be used by 1 NFS server and 1 CIFS server.  
     server_ifconfig -D cge0 -n cge0-1 can be done for the DM; cge0-1 can still be the interface for CIFS in VDM.  Alternatively, the DM can have other IP (eg cge0-2) if it is desired to match the IP/hostname of other CIFS/VDM.  
<LI> Export FS thru VDM first, then NFS export use the /root_vdm_N/mountPoint path.
<BR>
<BR>

Use VDM instead of DM (server_2) for CIFS server.
A VDM is really just a file system.  Thus, it can be copied/replicated.  
Because windows group and many other system data is not stored at the underlaying Unix FS, there was a need 
to easily backup/migrate CIFS server.  
<BR>

For multi-protocol, it is best to have 1 VDM to provide CIFS access, and NFS will ride on the Physical DM.  
<BR>


CAVA complication: The Antivirus scanning feature must be connected to a physical CIFS server, not to a VDM.
This is because it is 1 CAVA for the whole DM, not multiple instance for multiple VDM that may exist on a DM.
Global CIFS share is also required.   
May still want to just use physical DM with limited windows user/group config, as that may not readily migrate or backup.
<BR>
Overall, still think that there is a need of 2 IP per DM.  Maybe VDM and NFS DM have same IP so that it can have same hostname.  But the Global CIFS share will ride on a Physical DM with a separate IP that user don't need to know.  Finally, perhaps scrap the idea of VDM, but then one may pay dearly in replication/backup...


<BR>






<H2> Celerra Howto </H2>

<H4>Create a Server</H4>
<PRE>
* Create a NFS server 
	- Really just ensuring a DM (eg server_2) is acting as primary, and
	- Create logical Network interface (server_ifconfig -c -n cge0-1 ...)
	  (DM always exist, but if it is doing CIFS thru VDM only, then it has no IP and thus can't do NFS export).

* Create Physical CIFS sesrver (server_setup server_2 -P cifs ...)  
    OR
  VDM to host CIFS server (nas_server -name VDM2 -type vdm -create server_2 -setstate loaded)
    + Start CIFS service (server_setup server_2 -P cifs -o start)
    + Join CIFS server to domain (server_cifs VDM2 -J ...)
</PRE>


<H4>Create FS and Share</H4>
<OL>  
<LI>Find space to host the FS (nas_pool for AVM, nas_disk for masoquistic MVM)
<LI>Create the FS (nas_fs -n FSNAME -c ...)
<LI>Mount FS in VDM, then DM (server_mountpoint -c, server_mount)
<LI>Share it on windows via VDM           (server_export -P cifs VDM2 -n FSNAME /FsMount)
<LI>Export the share "via the vdm path"   (server_export -o root=... /root_vdm_N/FsMount)
</OL>  

Note that for server creation, DM for NFS is created first, then VDM for CIFS. <BR>
But for FS sharing, it is first mounted/shared on VDM (CIFS), then DM (NFS). <BR>
This is because VDM mount will dictate the path used by the DM as /root_vdm_N. <BR>
It is kinda backward, almost like lower level DM need to go thru the higher level VDM, blame in on how the FS mount path ended up... <BR>

          careful with security implication!
	  Ownership is only maintained once, Take Ownership in windows will 
	  change file UID as viewed from Unix.)
# SECURE (check ACL on both Unix and Win before granting access)
# MIXED - Both NFS and CIFS client rights checked against ACL; Only a single set of security attributes maintained 
# MIXED_COMPAT - MIXED with compatible features 
 
NetApp Mixed Mode is like EMC Native.  Any sort of mixed mode is likely asking for problem.  
Stict to either only NT or only Unix is the best bet.

</PRE>

<font color='red'>WARNING</font><BR>

The access= clause on Celerra is likely what one need to use in place 
of the traditional rw= list.
<PRE>
## root=host1:host2,
## rw=host1:host2:hostN,
## access=host1:host2:hostN

## Celerra require access to be assigned, which effectively limit which host can mount.
## the read/write list is not effective (I don't know what it is really good for)
## access= (open to all by default), and any host that can mount can write to the FS, 
## even those not listed in rw=...  
## (file system level NFS ACL still control who have write, but UID in NFS can easily be faked by client)
## In summary: for IP-based access limitation to Celerra, access= is needed.
## (can probably omit rw=)
## rw= is the correct settings as per man page on the control station.
## The PDF paints a different pictures though.  

# NFS share is default if not specified
# On VDM, export is only for CIFS protocol
# NFS exports are stored in some file,

<H3>UserMapper</H3>

Usermapper in EMC is substantially different than in the NetApp.  RTFM!
<BR><BR>
It is a program that generate UID for new windows user that it has never seen before.  Files are stored in Unix style by the DM, thus SID need to have a translation DB.  Usermapper provides this.  A single Usermapper is used for the entire cabinet (server_2, _3, _4, VDM2, VDM3, etc) to provide consistency.  
If you are a Windows-ONLY shop, with only 1 Celerra, this maybe okay.
But if there is any Unix, this is likely going to be a bad solution.
<BR>
<EM>If user get Unix UID, then the same user accessing files on windows or Unix is viewed as two different user, as UID from NIS will be different than UID created by usermapper!</EM>
<BR>
<BR>
UID lookup sequence:
<OL>
<LI>SecMap Persistent Cache
<LI>Global Data Mover SID Cache (seldom pose any problem)
<LI>local passwd/group file
<LI>NIS
<LI>Active Directory Mapping Utility (schema extension to AD for EMC use)
<LI>UserMapper database
</OL>

When a windows user hit the system (even for read access), Celerra need 
to find a UID for the user.  Technically, it consults NIS and/or local passwd file
first, failing that, it will dig in UserMapper.  Failing that, it will generate
a new UID as per UserMapper config.
<BR>
Howwever, to speed queries, a "cache" is used first all the time.  The cache 
is called SecMap.  However, it is really a binary database, and it is persisten
across reboot.  Thus, once a user has hit the Celerra, it will have an 
entry in the SecMap.  There is no time out or reboot that will
rid the user from SecMap.  Any changes to NIS and/or UserMapper won't be 
effective until the SecMap entry is manually deleted.


<BR>
Overall, EMC admit this too, UserMapper should not be used in heterogeneous
Windows/Unix environment.  If UID cannot be guaranteed from NIS (or LDAP)
then 3rd party tool from Centrify should be considered.




<PRE>

server_usermapper server_2 -enable	# enable usermapper service
server_usermapper server_2 -disable
# even with usermapper disabled, and passwd file in /.etc/passwd

# usermapper database should be back up periodically!
server_usermapper server_2 -remove -all		# remove usermapper database
						# Careful, file owner will change in subsequent access!!

There is no way to "edit" a single user, say to modify its UID.
Only choice is to Export the database, edit that file, then re-Import it back.
# as of Celerra version 5.5.32-4 (2008.06)

</PRE>


When multiple Celerra exist, UserMapper should be synchronized (one become primary, rest secondary).
<TT>server_usermapper ALL -enable primary=IP</TT>.
Note that even when sync is setup, no entry will be populated on secondary until a user hit the Celerra with request.
Ditto for the SecMap "cache" DB.


<PRE>

p28 of configuring Celerra User Mapping PDF:

Once you have NIS configured, the Data Mover automatically checks NIS for a user
and group name. By default, it checks for a username in the form username.domain
and a group name in the form groupname.domain. If you have added usernames
and groupnames to NIS without a domain association, you can set the cifs resolver
parameter so the Data Mover looks for the names without appending the domain.

server_param server_2  -facility cifs -info resolver
server_param server_2  -facility cifs -modify resolver -value 1
repeat to all DM, but not applicable to VDM

Setting the above will allow CIFS username lookup from NIS to match based on username, 
without the .domain suffix.  Use it!  (Haven't seen a situation where this is bad)


server_param server_2 -f cifs -m acl.useUnixGid -v 1

Repeat for for all DM, but not for VDM.
This setting affect only files created on windows.  UID is mapped by usermapper.
GID of the file will by default map to whatever GID that Domain User maps to.
Setting this setting, unix primary group of the user is looked up and used as 
the GID of any files created from windows.
Windows group permission settings retains whatever config is on windows 
(eg inherit from parent folder).

<H5>SecMap</H5>

Unlike UserMapper, which is human readable database (and authority db)
which exist one per NS80 cabinet (or sync b/w multiple cabinet), 
the SecMap database exist one per CIFS server (whether it is physcial DM or VDM).

<H3>Config Files</H3>


A number of files are stored in etc folder.
retrieve/post using

<BR>
eg: server_file server_3 -get passwd ./server_3.passwd.txt
would retrieve the passwd file local to that data mover.

<BR>
Each File System have a /.etc dir.  It is best practice to create a subdirectory (QTree) below the root of the FS and then export this dir instead.  <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On the control station, there are config files stored in:
<LI>/nas/server
<LI>/nas/site
<BR>

Server parameters (most of which require reboot to take effect), are stored in:
<LI>/nas/site/slot_param  for the whole cabinet (all server_* and vdm)
<LI>/nas/server/slot_X/param (for each DM X)

CheckPoint

Snapshots are known as CheckPoint in EMC speak.
<BR>
Requires a SaveVol to keep the "copy on write" date.  It is created automatically when first checkpoint is created, and by default grows automatically  (at 90% high water mark).  But it cannot be strunk.  When the last checkpoint is deleted, the SaveVol is removed.

<BR>
GUI is the only sane way to edit it.  Has abilities to create automated 
schedules for hourly, daily, weekly, monthly checkpoints.

Backup and Restore, Disaster Recovery
</H3>

For NDMP backup, each Data Mover should be fiber connected to a tape drive (dedicated).  Once zoning is in place, need to tell data mover to scan for the tapes.


<H3>Quotas</H3>


Change to use Filesize policy during initial setup 
as windows does not support block policy (which is Celerra default).
<BR>
Edit the <TT>/nas/site/slot_param</TT> on the control station (what happen to standby control station?)
add the following entry:
<PRE class="cf">
param quota policy=filesize
</PRE>

Since this is a param change, retarded EMC requies a reboot:<BR>
<TT>server_cpu server_2 -r now</TT><BR>
Repeat for additional DM that may exist on the same cabinet.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
----
<BR>

Two "flavor" of quotas:  Tree Quota, and User/Group quota.  Both are per FS.
<BR>
Tree Quoata requires creating directory (like NetApp qtree, but at any level in the FS).  There is no turning off tree quota, it can only be removed when all files in the tree is deleted.  <BR>
User/Group quota can be created per FS.  Enableling require <EM>freezing of the FS</EM>
for it to catalog/count the file size before it is available again!   
Disabling the quota has the same effect.  
<BR>
User/Group quota default have 0 limit, which is monitoring only, but 
does not actually have hard quota or enforce anything.
<BR>
<BR>
----
<BR>
Each File System still need to have quota enabled... (?)
Default behaviour is to deny when quota is exceeded.  This "Deny Disk Space" can be changed (on the fly w/o reboot?) <BR>
<LI>GUI: File System Quotas, Settings.
<LI>CLI: nas_quotas -user -edit config -fs <I>FSNAME</I>  ++ repeat for Tree Quota ?? 
But by default, quota limit is set to 0, which is to say it is only doing tracking, so may not need to change behaviour to allow.
<BR>
<BR>
Celerra manager is easiest to use.
GUI allows showing all QTree for all FS, but CLI don't have this capability.  Sucks eh?  :(
<BR>
<BR>


EMC recommends turning on FileSystem quota whenever FS is created.
But nas_quotas -on -tree ... -path /   is denied, how to do this??!!

<PRE>
# Create Tree Quota (NA QTree).  Should do this for each of the subdir in the FS that is directly exported.
nas_quotas -on  -tree -fs CompChemHome -path /qtree	# create qtree on a fs
nas_quotas -off -tree -fs CompChemHome -path /qtree	# destroy qtree on a fs (path has to be empty)
	# can remove qtree by removing dir on the FS from Unix host, seems to works fine.
nas_quotas -report -tree -fs CompChemHome		# display qtree quota usage


# per user quota, not too important other than Home dir... 
# (and only if user home dir is not a qtree, useful in /home/grp/username FS tree)
nas_quotas -on -user -fs CompChemHome			# track user usage on whole FS
							# def limit is 0 = tracking only
nas_quotas -report -user -fs CompChemHome		# display users space usage on whole FS

nas_quotas -user -clear -fs FSNAME	# clear quota: reset to 0, turn quota off.

<H4>Tree Quota</H4>
<PRE>

nas_quotas -on -fs FSNAME -path /tree1		# create qtree on FS                (for user???) ++
nas_quotas -on -fs FSNAME -path /subdir/tree2	# qtree can be a lower level dir

nas_quotas -off -fs FSNAME -path /tree1		# disable user quota (why user?)
						# does it req dir to be empty??
nas_quotas -e -fs FSNAME -path /tree1 user_id	# -e,  -edit user quota
nas_quotas -r -fs FSNAME -path /tree1		# -r = -report


nas_quotas -t -on -fs FSNAME -path /tree3	# -t = tree quota, this eg turns it on on
						# if no -t defined, it is for the user??
nas_quotas -t -list -fs FSNAME			# list tree quota


To turn off Tree Quotas:
- Path MUST BE EMPTY !!!!!	ie, delete all the files, or move them out.  
				can one ask for a harder way of turning something off??!!
				Only alternative is to set quota value to 0 so it becomes tracking only, 
				but not fully off.


Quota Policy change:
- Quota check of block size (default) vs file size (windows only support this).
- Exceed quota :: deny disk space or allow to continue.
The policy need to be established from the getgo.  They can't really be changed as:
    	- Param change require reboot
	- All quotas need to be turned OFF  (which requires path to be empty).

Way to go EMC!  NetApp is much less draconian in such change.  
Probably best to just not use quota at all on EMC!
If everything is set to 0 and just use for tracking, maybe okay.  
God forbid if you change your mind!

Note that when moving VDM from server_2 to server_3, outside of the fail over, the IP address are changed.
This is because such a move is from one active DM to another.

Sys admin can create accoutn for themselves into the /etc/passwd of the control station(s).
Any user that have login via ssh to the control station can issue the bulk of the commands to control the Celerra.
the nasadmin account is the same kind of generic user account.
(ie, don't join the control station to NIS/LDAP for general user login!!)
<BR>
<BR>

There is a root user, with password typically set to be same as nasadmin.  
root is needed on some special command in /nas/sbin, such as navicli to access the backend CX.
