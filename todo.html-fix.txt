Various errors that should be fixed:

- one line reads MEA instead of META.  many files need to be fixed.
- add header line to many docs.  see sol.html or template.html

- run thru the html validator.w3c.org to see that html don't have errors, help search engines too.
   start with template.html...
	* need </li>  ??  thought i read somewhere that new html don't need that anymore after all...
