<H1>Isilon</H1>

<H2>101</H2>

<PRE>

isilon stores both windows sid and unix uid/gid with each file.
When nfs client look at file created on windows, file may not have uid/gid in it.   
isilon looks up the conversion from its mapping db.
if it can't find one, it will generate a number, starting at 10000.

<H4>HD Replacement</H4>

<EM>Ensure drive is in REPLACE state before removing it, even when LED is RED!!</EM>

Sometime SmartFail is running on a drive, it will put LED as RED, but then still actively copying data out.  Removing the drive at this time 
is NOT good.  Especially at reduced redundancy state, this could result in data lost!!  <BR>
<BR>
Typical protection policy is +2:1 which can tolerate two drive failure at the same time.  But under some certain circumpstance, eg node fail and autobalance job did not complete, protection could drop down to just 2x.  ie mirror, and two disks within a protection group could fail at the same time and it would have data lost.   Protection group can and typically do span multiple nodes.  Files (LIN) at 2x scenario may just span mirrored pair across two nodes and one can hit the lotto and have those two disks fails at same time.  <BR>

/var/log/messages would spill error like too many restripe error.  Complain about LIN=... having problems.  <BR>
<BR>

On each disk, Isilon lay a two digits lnum N on it, and refers to it when smart failing drive, running FlexProtect job.  
When drives are pulled out, replaced or swapped out in a bay, can tell system what/how to use the disk based on this lnum.  It is kept track of until all necessary data has been recovered by FlexProtect job.  (and at time may need to manually remove them, stopfail command?)

<div class="quotebox"><PRE>
    1:  The DB that you are looking at only has the fields that you are seeing listed.  
    With the current output it will give you the SID and UID of the users mapped.  
    With these commands you can find the username that is mapped to that information:
    #isi auth ads users list --uid={uid}
    or
    #isi auth ads users list --sid={sid}

    2:  The entries in the DB are made as the users authenticate to the cluster.  
    So when a client tries to access the share, the client sends over the SID, 
    we check the DB and if no entry is found, we check with NIS/LDAP, 
    if nothing is found there, we generate our own ID (10000 range) and add it to the DB.  
    Any subsequent access from that SID will be mapped to the UID in that DB.

    3:  You can run the following to get the groups and the same rules 
    apply for the GID and SID lookups:
    #sqlite3 /ifs/.ifsvar/likewise/db/idmap.db 'select sid,id from idmap_table where type=2;'
    #isi auth ads groups list --gid={gid}
    #isi auth ads groups list --sid={sid}

    4:  You can delete the entries in the database, 
    but the current permissions on files will remain the same.  
    So when the user re-accesses the cluster he will go through the 
    process outlined in question 1.

<OL>
<LI>If changing from one domain to another (that is still trustted), ensure Server object is removed from old domain.  Else, user authentication may fail, as AD will try to lookup server object from old domain, which now has stale password and no longer functional for communicating with Isilon.
<LI>new view \\IP-of-isilon-node will use NTLM authentication, no kerberos.

<H3>
SmartConnect/Network
</H3>

Isilon SmartConnect is essentially DNS Round Robin.  Lot of address to each node, so that it can load balance, fail over, etc.
NFS is stateless, this works well (with Dynamic IP allocation).  <BR>
SMB is stateful.  One support guy recommended that a different SmartConnect pool of IP address be created for windows client to use.  And this pool to use STATIC IP mapping to the node, so that no IP change will take place in load balance, avoiding potential stateful protocol violation (but don't think ever experienced).  
<BR>

<PRE>
isi network modify pool ten:ten --sc-rebalance
# rebalance SmartConnect IP pool (redistribute them across isilon nodes).
# ten:ten refers to the names of vlan the rebalance will work on
</PRE>



<H3>
Snapshot
</H3>

<p>
Snapshots take up space reported as usable space on the fs.   <BR>
cd .snapshot <BR>
Admin can manually delete snapshot, or take snapshot of a specific directory tree instead of the whole OneFS. <BR>

</p>

<H3>
Quotas
</H3>

<PRE>
isi quota list

Each directory tree that has quota setup make up a Quota Domain.
Files can NOT be moved between quota domains.  Copy and remove must be used in such case!!

</PRE>

<H3>CIFS</H3>
<H4>ACL</H4>

<PRE>
ACE = Access Control Entry
ACL = Access Control List, a list of ACE
DACL = Deny ACL 

ls -led			# show ACL for the current dir (or file if filename given)
ls -lze   		# display ACE of a file
ls -l			# regular unix ls, but + after the permission bits indicate presence of CIFS ACL
setfacl -b     filename	# remove all ACL for the file, turning it back to unix permission    # works in OneFS 6.x only
chmod   -b 600 filename	# OneFS 7 onward consolidated setfacl into chmod.  chmod -b req specification of new unix perms to give the file

chmod   -D filename     # remove all ACE, does NOT only strip NTFS ACL, but result in equiv of chmod 000  !!
chmod   -N filename     # set NULL to DACL, esentially open file for EVERYBODY.  avoid!!
chmod  700 filename	# will set unix bit as commanded, and drop th ACL (or only cuz all ACE were null?)
chmod +a user DOMAIN\\username  allow generic_all /ifs/path/to/file.txt		# place NTFS ACL on file, granting user full access


ACL/ACE related flags in chmod:

     -E      Reads the ACL from stdin, as a sequential list of ACEs, separated
             by newlines, and ending in a new line.  If the input parses cor-
             rectly, the existing ACL is replaced.  If the user/group name is
             multiple words it must be placed in double quotes.  For example:
             group "domain users" allow file_read.

     -C      Returns false if any of the named files have ACLs in non-canoni-
             cal order.

     -D      Removes all ACEs in the security descriptor's DACL for all named
             files.  This results in implictly denying everything.

     -N      Removes the security descriptor's DACL and sets it to NULL for
             all named files.  This results in implicitly allowing everything.

     -i      Removes the 'inherited' bit from all entries in the named file(s)
             ACLs.

     -I      Removes all inherited entries from the named file(s) ACL(s).

     -b      Removes the ACL and replaces with the specified mode.



ls -lR | grep -e "+" -e "/" | grep -B 1 "+"				# recursively list files with NTFS ACL, short version
ls -lR | grep -e "^.......... +" -e "/"  | grep -B 1 "^.......... +"	# morse code version, works better if there are files w/ + in the name

One may need to restart sshd, but in my experience sshd pick up this new template in less than a minute and users will be prevented from logging in via ssh.

In OneFS 6.5, maybe the template will be replicated to all nodes?
Or maybe that's only for syslogd, but not sshd, as they are 
concerned it may lock user out from all the nodes from ssh access...

<LI>Isilon does not by default keep track of atime (due to performance concerns), one has to enable it.  see <A HREF="http://doc.isilon.com/onefs/7.1.0/help/en-us/GUID-29A0548E-C9C6-4692-A608-67DF9657F47B.html">OneFS 7.1.0 doc</A>.  This has an implication that if want to delete old files by last access time (find -atime +30 -delete), it seems to be silently reverting to depends on ctime or mtime :(
<LI> atime = access time (when file is read)
<LI> ctime = change time, kept by system.  chmod, chown are considered changes and thus update the ctime of the file.
<LI> mtime = modification time, and refer to actual file data content (and ignore meta data changes).  Furthermore, user can set mtime using the <TT>touch -t nnn</TT> command against the file.
<LI> <A HREF="http://www.unix.com/tips-and-tutorials/20526-mtime-ctime-atime.html">ctime vs mtime</A> (postmark vs hand written date)
</UL>

To enable/disable atime track:
<PRE>

sysctl efs.bam.atime_enable=1			# 1=enable, 0=disable
sysctl efs.bam.atime_grace_period=1209600	# how often to update last-access time, 1209600 sec = 2 weeks.
