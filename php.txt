To add php support, update httpd.conf with:

LoadModule php5_module        /usr/lib64/httpd/modules/libphp5.so
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .phps .php3 .fds
AddHandler php5-script .php
## AddHandler not absolutely necessary.

/usr/lib64/httpd/modules/libphp5.so was installed by a compilation of php source as
./configure --with-apxs2=/usr/sbin/apxs
make; make install



create .php file like normal .html file
code appears between <?php   ... ?> tags.
html won't render them (but will show up in source html code.
php handler will run the php and put output in those tags.

.php don't need to be in cgi-bin directory/environment.  It can go 
anywhere where .html files are served by the web server.





eg:

This is HTML text here.
<BR>
PHP code follows...
<BR>


<I>Calling php echo hello world ...</I><BR>
<?php
    echo 'Hello world';
?>
<BR>
<I>...Done php echo hello world</I><BR>




<I>Calling incl eg-php-html2.php ...</I><BR>

<?php
include('eg-php-html2.php');
?>
<BR>
<I>Done Calling incl eg-php-html2.php</I><BR>



<?php phpinfo() ?>
