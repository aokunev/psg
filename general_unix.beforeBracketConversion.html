<H1>Commands</H1>
This document will cover the generic Unix commands that are largely the same on all
flavors of Unix.



<A NAME="bla"></A>
<H1></H1>
<!-- cmd.admin.ref.tr -->

<PRE>
crontab         show cron jobs
        -l = list
        -e = edit
        -r = remove  (no confirmation, everything gone for the user!!)
        # file format: 
        # minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week0=sun cmdline 
        # 0-59   0-23 1-31         1-12  0-6              echo "Hello World!"


newgrp	groupname	# change the default group user will create file as 
			# only last for current session
			# Can prompt for password if group is password protected?


</PRE>

<A ID="wget"></A>
<H5>wget </H5>

<PRE>

-h		= brief help, no man pages needed.
-r 		= recursive
-l1  		= depth level, default to 5
--no-parent	= don't bother with ref to parent dir (-np)
-A.gif		= download only .gif files

-c		= continue previous interrupted download
-nc		= no clobber of existing files
-b 		= process job in background, returning to prompt
--passive-ftp	= use passive ftp

-k		= change link ( convert non-relative links to relative)
-m		= mirror site  options, eg, download file only if newer.
-l=20		= retrieve to depth = 20

--http-user=USER	= web page with user/login req
--http-passwd=PASS
--convert-links		= convert the downloaded html link to local files
-Pdownloaddir		= place downloaded file in downloaddir instead of the www.server.com/ name.


eg download only *.gif files from server
wget -r -l1 --no-parent -A.gif http://www.server.com/dir/

eg2, ftp with username and password as username:password@site:
wget ftp://hniksic:mypassword@unix.server.com/mydir

eg3: download ibm patches, which is dir with set of links.
wget --glob=on --retr-symlinks --level=1 ftp://service.boulder.ibm.com/aix/fixes/pkgs/p3dia/* 

eg4: getting suse linux from ftp site:
wget -r -m  -np -c -l10 ftp://ftp.oregonstate.edu/pub/suse/suse/i386/8.2/

wget obeys robot rules. in file /robot.txt

If proxy is mandatory, set the proxy server thru env var http_proxy and ftp_proxy.  eg:
setenv http_proxy "http://proxy.nova.org:8080"
export ftp_proxy="http://proxy.nova.org:8080"
If auth is req, wget has parameters to submit these also.  



</PRE>
<!-- 
 ----------
rest of wget.ref as internal note.
   
wget -r --no-parent http://www.fiu.edu/~tho01/
wget -r -c ftp://tin:passwd@aiur.fiu.edu/ep2/			# note that it ftp in and use user home dir at starting point.
alias wwget='wget -r -c --no-parent -l5'

end of old wget internal notes

<A name="rsync"></A>
<H5>rsync</H5>
<PRE>
rsync -avul source /path/to/destination
            sync ./source to /path/to/destination
            source or destination could be NFS mounted location.
            only newer files in local dir will be copied to dest
            if dest has newer file, they will not be changed.
      -a    archive mode, preserve sym link, attributes, owner/perm, etc.
      -n    dry run, use w/ -v and will list files that will be cp'ed
            w/o actually doing it.
      -l    copy sym link as sym link (like tar)
      -L    copy file refered by the sym link
      -z    use compression during transfer (when used with remote host)
	--delete	delete files in dst that is not in source
			Use this to sync/backup user /home during migration
	--preogress	show progress (useful when not in -v?)

rsync -avuL /f /cygdrive/p/backup_of_master_data_DrvF
            cmd used at home in win2003 to backup all data to removeble ide drv.
            does not support funky chinese mp3 filename :(


rsync -avl -e ssh  --rsync-path=/usr/local/bin/rsync remote-svr:/dir/* ./local/storage
	use ssh as transfer protocol with remote machine
	allow specification of where rsync is located on remote host
	either source or destination machine could be a server: kind of entry

ctrl-a, N = show number and title of current window
ctrl-a, k = kill current window
ctrl-a, S = create split window mode
ctrl-a, ^I= move focust to next split window (^I=TAB).

ctrl-a,ctrl-b= send a break

</PRE>


<A name="rcs"></A>
<H5>RCS</H5>

<PRE>
co -l <filename> check out file (with lock) from rcs sys
co -r <filename> check out revision <N> or the latest verstion, will prompt to overwrite co -l files (at least then when you do ci, it will say file not changed and effectively reversed to original content)
ci    <filename> put file back into rcs  
ci -u <filename> (the -u leave a read only copy of the file, as if run co immediately after ci, always use it:))

rlog <file>	display rcs edit log 
rcsdiff <file>	display diff b/w current file content and its previous version
rcsdiff -r1.1	display diff b/w current file and version 1.1 of the file
rcs -u <file>	forces an unlock a file locked by some other user.
rcs -aUID FILE	add access for user UID to the FILE (but didn't work, maybe file need to be group writable).

      grads netscape -d n10:0 &


find options
-user <uid>		: find all files owned by user
-exec <cmd> {} \;	: {} represent the matched entry (full path)
			  cmd will be executed with {} as arg
			  \; is required to end exec section

eg

finding files: (not 'correct' usage, but works :)
find . | grep 'filename'
or
find . -name FILENAME -print

find . -user root  -exec chown weblogic:weblogic {} \;
	run in weblogic dir, replace all files owned by root to weblogic
	(remember to change back to root the startWebLogic.sh back to root)

find . -perm -o+w -exec ls -l {} \;
	long listing of all files whose permission is world writable

find . ! -user tho01 -print
	list all files whose owner is not tho01

other cmd: ls -l, so to see full listing of file instead of just path, but any entry that is a dir will return rather long listing...  (can use  type=file only to skip dir):

find . -type f -ctime -5 -exec ls -l {} \;		# files modified less than 5 days ago.

grep pattern 	-A 3 	# show the maching line and 2 more lines After it
		-B 3	# show the maching line and 2 more lines Before it


xargs    	# grab a list of lines with single entry and turn it into a multi item single line list.  eg:
		# ls -1  | xargs echo       			# will be equiv of echo *
		# find /nfshome -name .rhosts | xargs chmod 600 

--

/usr/bin/logger -p daemon.notice "test msg by tin"
		append message to syslog, at level indicated by -p.
