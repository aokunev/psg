Here is a comparison of HPCS Singularity vs NeRSC Shifter.  They both bring the benefits of container to the HPC world.  As such, both provide very similar features.  The subtleties are in their implementation approach.  MPI maybe the place with the biggest difference.  <BR />

    <td>Misc</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>
    Singularity app can run outside HPC, without any job scheduler.  It can serve as a container for app portability outside the HPC world, and since a single file encompass the whole container, this maybe advantageous for sharing, portability and archive.  <BR />
    Singularity recommends compiling all apps into the Singularity container, spec files would need to be written.  I hear they are looking to adopt Docker and/or RKT specfile to minimize this burden.  <BR />
    Docker files can be imported or even run directly.  Given docker operate on a different paradigm, the hit-and-miss outcome of such conversion is understandable.  <BR />
    In future development, maybe NeRSC's shifter could  run singularity app as well.  <BR />
    </td>
    <td>
    Shifter container/app can run as stand alone outside HPC scheduler.  This is certainly useful for testing and development.  However, if one isn't trying to utilize container in HPC, maybe there is not much point in converting docker images to shifter images.  <BR />
    Shifter works by pulling the large number of existing containers.  Docker isn't needed inside the HPC, some gateway location can be used for Shifter to pull docker images and store converted image in a location accessible cluster-wide, eg /scratch.  See <A HREF="https://tin6150.github.io/psg/blogger_container_hpc.html#shifter_workflow">shifter workflow</A> below for more details. <BR />

<H3>Example Commands in Docker</H3>

<PRE>
# get a container with anaconda python and jupyter notebook 

docker run -i -t -p 8888:8888 continuumio/anaconda /bin/bash -c "/opt/conda/bin/conda install jupyter -y --quiet && mkdir /opt/notebooks && /opt/conda/bin/jupyter notebook --notebook-dir=/opt/notebooks --ip='*' --port=8888 --no-browser"
</PRE>


<H3>Example Commands in Singularity</H3>


<PRE>
 
sudo  singularity create --size 2048 /opt/singularity_repo/ubuntu16.img
# Create an image file to host the content of the container.  
# Think of it like creating the virtual hard drive for a VM.
# The image created should be a sparse file (ie with holes),
# However, while ext4/ubuntu seems to result in compact file
# RHEL6/ext3 img take up their final file size.

sudo -E singularity bootstrap /opt/singularity_repo/ubuntu16.img /opt/src/singularity/examples/ubuntu.def
# "kickstart" build the container
# If behind a proxy, sudo -E will preserve http_proxy env var 

singularity shell ubuntu.def
singularity exec  ubuntu.img bash  # slight diff than shell, PS1 not changed, .bash_profile sourced here
singularity exec  centos.img  rpm -qa
# Note that uname and uptime will always report info of the host, not the container.

singularity  exec  -w  centos.img  zsh     # -w for writable container, FS ACL still applies
                                           # centos.img needs to be writable by the user
sudo singularity shell -w centos.img       # root can edit all contents inside container


# best to build up container using kickstart mentality.  
# ie, to add more packages to image, vi /opt/src/singularity/exampless/ubuntu.def   
# re-run bootstrap command again.  
# bootstap on existing image will build on top of it, not overwritting it/restarting from scratch
# singularity .def file is kinda like kickstart file
# unix commands can be run, but if there is any error, the bootstrap process ends.


# pipe and redirect works as input and output for singularity container executions: 

echo "echo hello world" | singularity exec centos7.img bash
singularity exec centos7.img echo 'echo hello world' | singularity exec centos7.img bash
singularity exec centos7.img rpm -qa | singularity exec centos7.img wc -l

singularity exec centos7.img python < ./myscript.py
